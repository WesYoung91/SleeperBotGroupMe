@Andy Rangel  sorry we all bailed on you. We'll make up for it Tomorrow night though.
And solve linear equations (not really) 
On the real tho Justin gave me a great idea @Justin Rossano gonna buy a big ass square calculator for the ACT 😂
@Todd Wiencek I fucking love you man I wish we could hang out more! 😍
😂😂😂
@Todd Wiencek witnessed it at that's all that matters. 
👀👀👀
@Cody Alexander not everyone 
Poll 'Do you share a blanket with your spouse?' has expired
null
Yes you did. Everyone at the Super Bowl party witnessed it. 
Never agreed @Cody Alexander 
I told just Justin I’d rather wear a thong and nothing else and stand on a street Corner holding a sign that says I suck at Fantasy football 🤷🏽‍♂️
He also agreed to it. It's on him. 
😒
True. Also, no one has stayed after losing. 
The last three years and nothing!!! No punishment 
In his defense no one has done anything after losing 
@Andy Rangel Doesn’t understand the concept of “non-refundable”
Wow 
Don't suck dick at fantasy and you wouldn't have to go @Andy Rangel 
MONEY that can be used for LEAGUE OUTINGS 
Can’t get the money back
Just think if if we cancel we get that league money back! 
Poll 'Do you share a blanket with your spouse?' is about to expire
Don’t let the white man keep you down. 
I tried Justin said no 🙄
#resist
Get a refund 
Don’t go 
I’m so damn salty about taking that damn ACT Saturday 🙄

Y’all leave my buddy alone @Justin Rossano @Cody Alexander 
Created new poll 'Shirt options': https://s.groupme.com/15MPtRI
😘
Just more to love ❤️ 
👍
Well good @Wes. Nashville Tent and Awning isn't cheap so if we cancel yours it'll be cheaper 👍
Basic economics 
Yours is the reason the price jumped. They are sewing 3 shirts together. 🤣🤣
I don’t want a shirt that bad 
The $15 would be of each member paid for their own shirt.
Also, I’m waiting on the proofs for the shirts, but the design has been submitted. Cost for each person will be $6, but this will deplete all league funds. Not a huge issue. If the league would rather pay for the shirts outright, they are $15.
April 25th. It's a Thursday @Brian O'Cain 
What day are we supposed to be going to Nashville for the draft? 
@Brian O'Cain ........we got forks man

very modern.
app looks great.
I wanna say third as well
@Dylan Pine No. This is their 3rd I believe. If not it's their second. 
is this their first year?
@Keven Reed  is on board with a dynasty league but also said the same thing we've talked about before. when we do a dynasty league, we need to run a traditional league beside it.
The reviews on the App Store were good also
I looked through it last night and same thing. I couldn’t access any of that info
also looks like it offers a seamless transition to dynasty
I haven't found a demo league yet.
yeah me too. I wish we could see what a rosters page looks like.
I’m pretty damn excited about it. Everything I’ve looked at on the app is nice. I like the NFL news updates too
@Justin Rossano  you should have a c by your name now too

It has an open api that is very well documented. 
Not yet. About to though. 
@Cody Alexander Have you gotten into Sleeper and looked at it? It’s pretty nice
Fuck. Dumb asses
ESPN just deleted all league history in an update so we have nothing to lose by switching. 
It looks good man. I like the app layout

Let’s take a trip inside your mind 
How does it make you feel to know that you are a terrible person 
Are you apologizing for getting his straps rusty
Are you buying his breakfast 
Me and @Justin Rossano are on the way to Waffle House. @Andy Rangel you meeting us?
He's lashing out
Let’s reflect on this right now
Less deflection, more reflection
I must of struck a nerve 
FUCKING AUTOCORRECT THIS MORNING
@Justin Rossano Is it too late to change my shirt size from M to L? 
Fat
Shut up fast ass, no one's waving a donut around asking you to speak. 
Maybe we should bring bry into the mix
Yea he has a problem 
Less deflection, more reflection amirite guys?
Your*
My problem is solved. You're problem still exists. 
#CarpetCleaner #NeverForget
We are here because you have a problem 
We aren’t here for me right now buddy
I'm remedying my issue right now but @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot not so much
That's why I love him
I'm talking about you 🙄
It’s what he does best 
He's a master of deflection

So did you give Justin money 
Yea

You should of seen his Camry
Been like that for the longest
He just carries around shit in his truck. Always full of garbage inside and out 
null
Maybe 
At least the Mormon would return them
Fucker has had a truck for how long and he can’t go buy fucking straps 
we have two applicants already to replace him.
Start a new league?
We are all ashamed of him by association
🤷‍♂️
Just because 
Me too

I guess I'll have to get a divorce
By marriage
Why are you a thieving ghetto bitch
I'm ashamed that I'm sort of related to him.

Mariota gets season ending injury in pregame and tannehill takes the titans to the playoffs
Rams jaguars super bowl bortles vs foles
Tevin Coleman gets 2K in San Fransisco and is the leagues leading rusher leaving lots of people confused. 
Oooooooo...hot takes...
@Cody Alexander  let's get some hot takes in here.
Bold Prediction: Bortles plays more than 1 game this season.
Boner storm growing off the coast of LA
Bortles beats out Goff in pre-season to become the legitimate starter. Goes on to win 4 superbowls in the next 3 years. Hall of Fame first year he retires.

Stop, I can only get so erect

You always have to finish what you start
@Keven Reed is that why you were late to work?

I muted so I could finish jerking off without seeing your name pop up every five seconds
@Paul Miller Doesn’t mute so I just assume he actively ignores the league. 
Anybody have 4 friends that want to play fantasy?

He was the only one that understood my racism 
Me too. He may have been a raging alcoholic but at least he didn't mute. 
Gosh damn mutes!!!!!
Now we have a muter 
😭😭😭
I miss him😔
👀
null
@Dylan Pine Probably. 
@Chris Aka Flex-a-lot You want a job? 
let me guess he won’t show up to the draft at the last minute too?
We don’t make excuses in this league 
Can’t get good help these days. 
Excuses 
Wow. WOW
He’s also late to work again 🤦🏻‍♂️
🤷🏻‍♂️
I think it’s because he hasn’t downloaded the app and it auto mutes text alerts after a certain amount of messages. 
Already this early in the game and he silenced it
I stuck my neck out for him and everything 
Dammit
It's not your fault he's ungrateful. 🙄
null
I’ll have a talk with him at work today

My disappointment is immeasurable. Is it too late for a revote? @Justin Rossano @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @Wes

My grill is covered on the porch lol
Yep

So rusty and been in the rain

One of them is sitting on my grill. 
Oh I bet those bastards are destroyed 
Rusty and all
He will probably call you here shortly and ask if you really want the money and that he can bring the straps tomorrow or drop them off at a station
Bryanna is good for it
Yea good luck with getting money from him
🤣
Or should I ask Bryanna?
Naw - I'm keeping two of them sumbitches
Send it over
Shhhhhhhhhhhhh I want you to settle down sir. 
@Cody Alexander 
Just Venmo the money
@Wes ?
What show were you at?
null
It was like a foreign language but it was all English words. 
Lol
She's never had to say that
null
That’s real
The last show we went to, the guy behind me got my attention and proceeded to string the weirdest combination of words that made no sense. His girlfriend said “I’m sorry. He had a lot of cocaine.”
She's had to say it alot. 
😂
I’m sorry he does that when he is drunk 
Y’all down to fuck
😂
"he's a fucking idiot - I'm so sorry" - Bryanna to lots of people
She’s always apologizing for something he did 
I’m going to bring that up next time we are out 
😂😂 still funny that bry apologizes
Incorrect. 
Also wasn't cleaned. 
Gave it back to me with panzers piss in it still
Not surprised 
🙄 wasn't broken. 
Damn
Broke my mother fucking carpet cleaner and didn’t even clean the fucker
Lol. I thought about that tonight while I was cleaning my carpet cleaner. 
Yea bry felt so bad she apologized for him
I had some and I let someone borrow them. 
God!!!
Remember what he did to your carpet cleaner 
He can go buy a ratchet for himself and keep them in his truck like a big boy 
Damnit @Todd Wiencek, I traded time with Corey to work for you and I'm at 2 tomorrow. We could've watched Sunny together. I see how it is. 😔
I’ve learned to just say no
Cody has been switched from pumpkin butt to Ratchet Thief
👀
It’s been thrown away since 
That’s 2
He spilled garbage juice on mine 
No fucker, you borrowed one, then another one when you took the grill. 
Rachet thief sounds pretty hilarious if you don’t know the context. Also if you do haha 
And smells like garbage
It’s probably molded 
First off, It was one strap. Second off, I have it bitch. 
null
Just go ahead and buy me 2 new straps buddy. 
I'll take it. I love Sunny. 
Lol I think so. Haha one more suggestion and ill stop. Clown-baby. I stole that from Sunny but I think it’s fantastic and works for anyone 
Damnit Christopher!
Ratchet thief
😂😂
👀👀👀
Hey bitch @Cody Alexander how about my 2 ratchet straps?
I returned that strap. You know, just later. 
👀
And strap
A hurtful point. Words hurt Wesley. 
Todd has a nice kayak
👋 @Todd Wiencek 
No. I like Todd. I was simply making a point. 
😳
Who said that? @Wes ?
Thanks Justin. I was worried I was being ostracized from the league, after reading how big of a bitch I was for a while on the higher up threads
Todd is on Fire 
Turbo-Taint has a nice ring to it. I may be willing to compromise 
Look Gemini taint, @Todd Wiencek already called dibs.

Laser was a pretty bad ass gladiator if I remember correctly.
Mentioning Florida man - everyone needs to watch The Legend of Cocaine Island on Netflix. It's awesome. A great Florida man tale. 
Too bad there’s not a Florida themed gladiator for Justin 
@Todd Wiencek saves the best for the end
Holy shit @Todd Wiencek that's it! @Brian O'Cain is Florida Man!

And Justin

Since Andy and Justin liked my last message, that no one else even acknowledged... 😢 might I suggest these recommendations for Andy and Justin? First for Andy. 
😔
Or we could just borrow from the American gladiators catalog. Perhaps spice them up with a little homoerotic flair?
If it makes you feel any better @Todd Wiencek - I told Wes earlier I was going to call Nashville Tent and Awning so they could get started on making his shirt. 
I feel like the names should be a little more mean spirited and hurtful 
Or Beliber
It was discussed. That's up to y'all...
@Cody Alexander should have ellen on thr back of shirt
Put me size Medium 
@Justin Rossano The Magazine

So what was your official vote @Wes ?

Has anyone confirmed if @Paul Miller  is still alive?
sure
Confirmed?
🤷‍♀️
He did?
he voted for Greg
@Nick  Brown  have you voted?
in that regard, it's at a majority vote right now.
Agreed. 
We don’t need all 11. If we’re waiting on one vote, it won’t change the results 
if everyone's voted, is there a point in leaving it open?
If*
Can we call it off we get all 11 @Justin Rossano ?
@Paul Miller probably and my guess would be @TheTRUEJerk

I am in the process of making league t-shirts for everyone. Probably a softball style shirt, with a nickname and number on the back. Each member can select their number, but the league is responsible for choosing nicknames. Submit any suggestions for each person.

You can’t offend the offensive 
Arghhhhhhhhhhhhh
Get on it!!!!!!
Get on my god damn level baby
It’s not the vote. You’re generally a cynical cunt. 
I wasn’t offended weak ass 
You misspelled I'm angry you won't blindly vote someone in that you don't know
😳
Is it ironic/coincidental that the two people who were offended and left the league chat earlier didn’t attend the Super Bowl party???
I literally don’t like you as a person. Unfortunately you’re family. 
Hush mode initiated
You really can’t argue with that logic ☝🏻
Should've come to the super bowl party where we discussed and voted on how to fill the spot @Wes 
One day the league will not be fit to join do to what you will have to do to get in 
The champ has spoken
We don’t need another of these
Like
This?
Yes
So yes
No more than normal 
And would be guaranteed acceptance to the league. Otherwise he just has to go through the process just like everyone else
Does he look like a creepy computer guy?

It has to be legally done 
Agreed
If he does that, I will pitch in on his fees

It's just 1 letter. Is he willing to do that?
Cubical?

If Keven legally changes his name, he can be in the league 
Who is this Keven guy you have a crush on? 
I would like his parents number as a character reference
@Chris Aka Flex-a-lot has wanted to do the application thing for awhile. He's doing it. 
Do you want his parents number? 
Keven spells his name weird and I find that offensive. 🤣🤣

Hey Todd 
I’ll leave it at this, keven was ready to join last year to take nicks spot at the last possible moment. That should put him at a priority spot. 
Do what now...?
Did we vote on mason joining? Did we vote on @Todd Wiencek? Did they fill out an application?

Yea Cody
if you want to be in control so bad why don't you?
We should meet them at the draft 
Shhhhh peasant not up to you 
I think the commissioners should decide the decision process.
All the perspectives should come to the draft and we can meet them and decide. 
I decide who is fit not these so called I won the league guys
I am the alpha it’s up to me
I will decide on Keven later 
And?
Keven has been on the waiting list 
Shutting that down 
Family isn’t good I should know

I think Andy should do a remake from a local celebrity and it kinda sums up his fantasy career. #creekwaterwhyte #aka thabandit 
Go ask
Yea he is just hanging around not busy
A little long term brain damage never hurt anyone. Ask Aaron Hernandez.
So maybe it will stick around 
And it’s taking itself a lot more seriously than XFL did 
I mean, this guys are gonna have short careers and long term brain damage but it’s fun AF to watch

I saw that legal hit in the qb 
He's just not a winner 🤷🏽‍♂️
Y’all see any of that AAF

Can’t handle it then can’t join the league

Perfect

Keven is looking for a serious league 
The guy that’s played fantasy for years 
Yea fill it with Peggy

Or just fill it with Keven who was ready to go last year when we thought we’d have to fill a spot on short notice 
I’m not commissioner
That's your job ho bitch
Then you better get started pussy
I'll pay when we have a questionnaire to fill the empty spot...

Calm down vin diesel 
You have 9 other fingers that work 
Wives get to meet each other, cigars, good food. 
What family 
No one checked on me when I broke my finger
That’s what I said last year too
It's not even about the super bowl, it's about family. If the game sucks, then we will just eat and hang out by the fire 
#kneeling
Not going to support teams that will make for a shitty Super Bowl
They let me down
But like always
I told Cody if the cowboys went all the way then I would come
Brian done put him in a corner
�
😱
Then there is no excuse @Wes 
I’ll give up my commission for Brian. 
I have YouTube tv. It’s nice. 
I’d vote for Brian to be commissioner
I like it 
Brian can you host next time? 
Already doing champion level stuff
Is YouTube tv any good
Brian is a real bro 
You two should car pool and head back early if needed. I will share my YouTube TV with you if you need to catch some of the game if you leave early 
If nick drinks a shit ton I’ll come
NW? 
I’ll come if nick comes 
Brian takes cool videos 
If Dylan won’t go I’m in
Wes has a lying problem I suppose 
And is open and accepting to others. 
He’s awesome. 
null
I’d come it if was at Brian’s house. 
@Brian O'Cain You’re wasting your breath 
You’re*

null
Who is she
We haven’t heard from Paul in months.

@Chris Aka Flex-a-lot when the party comes in the conversation 
Good food too. Your a foodie and you should be there 
But it's a man night with lots of food and guy stuff and your not coming 
Just find a waitress to hang out for me. 
Kinda 
I thought league events were optional 
@Brian O'Cain Remember who is there for you tonight come next season when trades start being tossed around 
null
I think it’s disrespectful to not honor the incoming champion.
At least they would come to the SB 
We also offered to have it up there
Maybe 
Don’t give me that BS
Cody smokes 
You could have rode with Cody. Carpooled. 
Maybe you should just start a new league of people that are firefighters and live close to you. 
Is a interstate 
null
Too far away.

Too many people streaming. I just let Chris and Cody know that I'll probably be shutting it down soon. I'll send you your money back when I do. It's just gotten too big and I can't even use my computer when people are streaming off of it.

@Cody Alexander Hatred for the Colts just multiplied 
He's already gotten his option some of which I'm. Pretty sure was guaranteed and he sits the fucking bench like a motherfucking bitch 
I was telling Wes earlier that Favre would've played. Cause Favre ain't no bitch. You would have to telle.i was going to die if I played not to play. 
Well man the fuck up and help your team get to the damn playoffs.....sore elbow. Pfft.....what ever. 
Bye
I'm done
Out*
I'm oit
Grew that horrendous mustache. 
Hasn't played a full year. 
Good when he plays but can't finish a season. 
I have been back and forth but I think I'm done with Mariota. He's not sturdy. Unreliable. 
My phone died - just like my hopes and dreams. 
Least penalized team.. ah nevermind 
We all. Get flags
You get a flag
You get a flag
He said "A flag, what else is new" 😂😂😂😂

yeah but if your team sucks all the way that would mess it up too. maybe just if your bench player out scored who you played points
Fucking too busy for out league pizza crust eating ass
Yeah fuck him
I don’t think @Paul Miller should get anything since he didn’t participate 
Get like me todd
QBs and D would fuck that up though
I won the transactions bitches woooooo
Nah I didn't win the bench points this year
That would be interesting. Like who had the least amount of points on the  bench the whole season? 
Chris would lose or win that 
we need a category for best start/sit decisions
😔
I can’t even win at losing 
Nah that's Andy
Worst trades? 
I’d win that 
Can we add a category for biggest disappointment 
One of these days I’ll win something

i don’t @Brian O'Cain. i inherited an ipad air that i use whenever i need one which isn’t often. no clue what a fair price is. it’s in decent shape iirc. small dent on the back i think
Cleaned the pellets out and restarted it and it’s been fine. 
I checked on it and it the temp was 80 and the basket was overflowing with pellets 
I need to make sure that it's compatible, I think I read the other day that it was 
@Brian O'Cain Ever had your pellet smoker burn out?

@Todd Wiencek has a good point. If we stop the auction. There are times where we literally can't touch our phones because we're busy serving the public (narcanning someone in a trailer park)
I’m all about eliminating wavers entirely. There are 5,000 web sites that give cell phone injury updates. If I’m on a med call, and miss a big pick, I’ll blame Wes for that! If it wasn’t  Wes’s fault!.. It had to be either Nick Brown or Brian O’Cain!

I'm going to masturbate with my tears now. Night night.

Records will determine initial matchups for the losers bracket, but that’s it. Records don’t matter.
just give me one more
I just need to win one more game
null
@Asian Nick Bout to go hard in that bracket
Especially since he's tied for last but record doesn't matter after this week anyway. 
Exactly
Winner of losers bracket. I want someone at least a little bitter to decide. 
@Wes Young 
Sounds good to me.
I kinda like that the winner of the losers bracket at least has final say on the video. Just a little more incentive to win that bracket.
Any of those are good options. 
Consensus, or league champion, or the winner of the losers bracket.
@Dylan Pine Right now
Consensus of everyone who made the winners bracket playoffs? 
And I think a t-shirt for the draft is a must, regardless of the rest. There are league funds to pay for one.
Don’t get me wrong, the music video thing is awesome. I’ve seen several, and they are all fantastic. If we were to do this, who gets the honor of choosing the video/song?
@Dylan Pine is good at video editing and he's tied for last...he's also very conveniently tied for last so...
Music video would be good, just hard to find time to do it.
I’m on board. T-shirt plus the ACT
like who has that kind of patience
what's crazy is it is so well done.
Maybe anaconda by Nicki mjnaj
Not gonna lie I'd get last place to remake a video
Last place should get a last place T-shirt

Front licence plate?
We could get a real lame shirt made and the loser had to wear it at the draft next year?

Ask@Dylan Pine  what he wants to do
I’m open to reasonable last place punishments, since this is the first year someone will participate and not drop out of the league.

@Andy Rangel @Asian Nick @Brian O'Cain @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Cody Alexander @Dylan Pine @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Brown @Paul Miller @Todd Wiencek @Wes Young

I wish @Todd Wiencek would drop Eckler instead of keeping him on his bench 👌🏼
I don’t think so. Yeldon and Hyde weren’t sexy options in my opinion
@Justin Rossano would it helped if I dropped Yeldon?
So with regards to the playoff situation, if Cody loses, but Nate and I win, we are in and Cody is out. 

If Nate loses and I lose, but I score 17 more points than Nate, I’m in and so is Cody.

If Nate wins and I lose, Nate and Cody are in(most likely scenario since Cody’s team is garbage) (and because Fournette wants to fuck me over this week)

#butpossiblywrong
#itsprobablyright

#ididthemath
Yeah, I'm sure. @Dylan Pine. You need Chris to lose out and you to win out and you get the wildcard so long as Paul wins the division. 
#dylancanmaketheplayoffs
Dylan is 3-8😳
😂😂😂
Hell naw I'm not sure lol
you sure?
He is still in the running 
@Dylan Pine disregard the points for. You won the head to head on Chris so you would trump him in the event of a tie. Basically you need Paul to win the division and to tie Christopher's record and you get the wildcard.
I need Paul to lose but he is playing Todd so it's a free gimme😔
😑😑😑
Who won their head to head
@Dylan Pine in order for you to get the wildcard you need Paul to win his division, Chris to lose both of his upcoming games, you to win both of yours, and to beat Chris in points for (you're 47 behind at the moment) so technically, you aren't out. 
😂
@Andy Rangel have you heard of Le'Veon Bell? 😏
I will give you cook and Michel 
16
Nate has 15 on Ingram any other bids?
By wild card....i mean paul with his shit record. 
Right now its nick, ocain, cody and the wild card
once he does the math about 4 times
Not sure about that, Cody would know 
depends on if i still got a chance at the playoffs 
Pine, is hunt for sale? 
blow it all on your 2016 magazine picks 😂

I'm with @Brian O'Cain here. He's making a move that helps his team. The $5 fee allows this move to happen.

You threatened me a couple of weeks ago and now I am responding 
This is a good move for my team and a checkmate for you @Justin Rossano 
No, but it can be if needed
I disagree with that in a completely unbiased way. 🤣
Is that in the constitution? 
In the text above yours 
Where does it say that? 
You cannot purposefully bench your quarterback. $5 penalty or not, there are other teams out there competing for a spot, and it should not be dictated by someone trying to set up their potential playoff matchups.
Yes, but in a good way 
Does it affect me
It's for the betterment of my team while securing the fate of my opponents 
😑
If not, I would like to prepare the reasons that I think it should be able to happen. 
I'm confused 
Can this happen? @Wes Young @Justin Rossano 
I agree with whatever craziness got you to the decision to bench Mahomes. 
It's not for you Cody, it just ensures my opponent at the playoffs

Nah I'm fucking with you. I took a couple days off to help with my tolerance

Happiness, joy, a good night's sleep, and peace.

Sorry. You're not in Dylan's conference. You would need Justin, Nate, and Nick Wayne to lose out and you to win out to have a shot I think.  
You're actually not out of the wild card race yet however you need a lot of things to happen. Specifically Dylan and Nick Wayne to lose games while you continue to win. 
Do we have some kind of wild card shit? Or am I out? I tried looking it up and I’m pretty sure I’m out. 0 and 7 is not that bad!

Trophies of the week:
Low score: I only got Family with 79.06 points
High score: Salty Bastards with 177.70 points
Repent of your  Sins Wesly barely beat Nothing Happens When You Die by a margin of 13.78
The YETI blown out by The  Struggle Bus by a margin of 37.80
Just to be clear, winning money is very unusual. I play a few bucks each week. I never win shit! I got super lucky. Play in my draftkings league. You’ll have a great chance of winning. Most of your competitors are alcoholics. We were born in the 80’s. Use that against us!

If any of y’all want in it’s $10. Only Sunday games. Winner takes all after the last game. But let it be known, I send flys to wounds in that league. 
I want to go back to Double Dogs.
I won $53 one time off $1. I’m pretty sure I’m even now. I’m a champion in my league though. I’ve created famines in my  draftkings league 
Nah, he’s down to party

Well, not yet. He still has the head to head matchup win

Wes has given me TEs twice now to replace an injured Gronk. I didn’t play them either time. I put all my faith in the titans

No
Are you sure?

Is the high score 176?
Witten chews Jerry's food up for him and feeds him like a baby bird.
"I changed that man's diapers. He's a saint" 
He likes wittens soft hands 
Also .. agree
and "I suck Jerry Jones off every Wednesday"
Agree 100 percent 
Something like "doing it after a touchdown is good for the game but he's only in his third year lets talk after 5 years of 17 interceptions a year"
@Wes Young 
What did Witten say? I missed it. 
It kinda is. He is the last one to touch the ball before the fumble 
This game is full of FrAnChIsE qBs
It's not Mariota fault bruh
Just give the ball to Zeke 
Fucking you on fucking Jason witten for byard celebration 
also, Mariota needs to retire at half time.
First, fuck Jason Witten on byard celebrating
Oh goodness

Look he actually tried and it worked. 
Bye bye DEZ

Gonna be most successful RB tandem ever - 60 points per game with both and they just stop passing this season. BOOM!
If you don't start bell this week why are you even playing?
As the Conner owner I don't like it. As the Bell owner I don't like it. 
that's the most likely scenario
Play them both and ruin Cody’s roster 
😂 
throw the rest of the season away and run it up the middle
If I were Tomlin I'd run him out of spite
Connor is a stud though and clearly they don’t miss Bell from a production stance 
Probably right. Get benched for the rest of the season, healthy, then traded or new contract
That was his plan all along 
Pittsburgh is stupid to play him with Connor rolling

Face you make when believe you were gonna be champion but then realized you didn’t draft Patrick Mahomes and Michael Thomas 
Week 10?
When we going back to Twin Peaks? 👀👀👀
LMFAO
I think it’s PAUL
😂🤣😭💀
Who is that guy in the background? 
Jimmy Graham outscored both of my RBs and WRs (13.5 to their combined 12.8) and i still beat Wes @Wes Young 😂
The league of lower expectations commissioner 
Holy shit that's good LMAO
😂😂😂
null
Yes punt return points are back too 
#askingforafriend
Are we bringing back punt return points?
Draft day would be fucking insane 
What about the cheat rule?  
I might even eliminate the TE position and just add a 3rd Flex 
And fitzmagic 
*brees 
All I know is I need Dak to come through 2morrow @Christopher Lynn Rangel 
Just think of having Mahomes and brews as your 2 QBs 🤤🤤🤤
#makethisleaguegreatagain
Gonna be averaging like 200 points next season 😏
null
😂
Basically while you were gone all hell broke loose. 
@Nick Brown Justin also resigned as commissioner and @Andy Rangel is the new commissioner. Per Andy, we will be getting rid of D and K, going to 2QB, full point PPR, and adding a flex spot.  
Nick Brown changed the group's name to Rossano Took That Loss😂

LETS ALSO ELIMINATE KICKERS AND RUN WITH 2 QBs!!!

🤣🤣🤣 What the fuck?
Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon.

Seriously, I would like to look into draft kings. Sounds awesome 
You don’t get a say in this. I am naming my successor
Accurate
I have a LOT of reading to catch up on 😕
Nah. My vote is Christopher. His first move is going to be attempting to get punt return points back back after he gets shut down he'll be fine.

Let me go on the record with this:

Fuck fantasy football. Worst thing ever. I want it out of my life. It just leaves me sad and disappointed. My entire team decides it wants to show the hell up, and I have to play the mother fucking Juggernaut this week. I don’t care. Someone can have my team. Who wants to be commissioner? I’m done. Fuck it.

DAMMMMMNNNNNNN!!! Did you see that INT? 
Fuck me, right?
@Wes Young rallies to get defensive scoring lowered. Defense puts up highest amount all year against him. LOL
@Andy Rangel gonna get lucky this week with that fucking defense
Look at that big juggling baffoon. LOL
That picture that you sent earlier of the bitch with the big forehead was just a premonition that Dobbs and his 5 head was going to have to play some for the Steelers today.
I told you starting Baker was a solid move. 
We still in it
Baker is back in and threw a TD 
I tried to tell you not to play fantasy football.

Ben didn't do well with Baltimore before 
Thought Baker would do better today 
So why didn't. You start ben
Mmmm Howard 
I didn't have room
Why ain't ya starting Ridley? 
Them Ridley bench points @Christopher Lynn Rangel 
Why ain't ya starting big ben

Coleman😳😳😳
@Justin Rossano Murray was just robbed of a TD 
I was asleep
I tried to get ahold of Wes this morning for like a hour to switch something but never got a response 
@Wes Young isn't reliable 
I'd trust @Justin Rossano  more than wes
Better do it quick 
Better hurry 
Call @Wes Young and have him switch someone out for you before the Patriots start. 
Gronk is a game time decision if you can believe that... I remember voting on this and I’m pretty sure I chose poorly 
Yeah call @Wes Young ASAP before the game starts.
So is there any way to add players on Sunday?

Thelin was a great pick up 
Gotta be able to compete with you in week 9
Andy needed some insurance at RB WR AND TE I guess
Didn’t wanna let Graham go, but it’s okay 
Picked up Lockett and Collins off the waiver last week. Wasn’t upset to see them go. 
What was Andy thinking? 
Trying to get to the top of my division
Man you scored huge on that. 
Thielen came home 
I saw that earlier and laughed my ass off

Shit son. The best firefighters on A shift for the last few years have been at 2-A. Ain't that right @Justin Rossano?
The only real fireman at 2 is old man Joe. 
Well....if it was station 2 that cooked.....they really arent firefighters. 
It seems everything tv has taught me is a lie. 
Good question
How do firefighters lose a chili cook-off to non firefighters 
Sheriff's department
Who won
Yes Cody....we know
That's my specialty @Nathaniel Collier 
That's the most stereotypical thing a firefighter could stir 
That is a literal picture of @Cody Alexander stiring up shit. 
Not anymore
@Nathaniel Collier isn't he your mentor?
Cody and his BFF today
@Todd Wiencek U just can’t catch a break.

Wes Young changed the topic to: 2018 or why does everything suck
I'm honestly not sure what I expected
Low expectations my friend 
Yep. Stupid, non-dynasty, waste of time ass league 
On the bright side, you won’t have the disappointment of making it to the playoffs and losing in the first round 
Might as well just mail it in this year @Wes Young

null
My excitement level 
Fuck off @Justin Rossano .....again like i said last week....you plan the shit when im at work.

Hopefully whoever you beat will cause them to miss the playoffs too
The only thing I’ve got going for me, is the embarrassment that me beating someone will cause them 
Dominating the fuck out of the bottom of the league
😔
I'm a little disappointed too I heard he was the shit at draft Kings and would dominate in the league
I'm disappointed because I was told that@Todd Wiencek  was about it and evidence suggests that he is in fact, not about it.
Don't question my loyalty to transactions beotch
@Christopher Lynn Rangel  holding strong to that Transaction King title. $16.50 in fees and 32(!!!!) drops
I'm a little low
@Nick Wayne  let me borrow some of that faab money
Shouldn't that say Chief Nick Brown? 
Ole Firefighter Nick Brown at Columbia State today. 
I think we should run a dynasty along side with our current 
Let's go dynasty next year. That way guys like me and @Paul Miller who are out of playoff contention can at least make moves for the future 
If you had agholor, I would trade you 1 for 1
So you want Henry?
@Wes Young i would need to replace him with a RB. Not sure that will work with our rosters

Dear lord baby Jesus let Tom Brady break a finger while practicing tonight 
I have heard that before somewhere 
Someone once told me you could go 0-4 and win the championship
null
Should of switched to CBS then that might not have happened
Gurly is going to single handily take my team down 
Man this game is ugly 
The Titans right now
The last 5 weeks of fantasy got rid of all of my shame 
Do you feel shame?
6 sacks 
null
You traitorous bitch @Wes Young 
Well there you go 😐
null
Shhhhhhhhh...let me live in my hopeful delusion.
Titans are about as spicy as a vanilla latte today
null
That's good 
I’ve got Crabtree’s old ass on my bench Wes 
It’s back up to speed 
The silver lining @Wes Young is that, with how ESPN is running, you won't know you lost until Friday or so.
I’ve got a lot of stock in the titans. It’s usually not a wise strategy 
God damn you @Todd Wiencek . You have me so conflicted. If the Titans do bad, I win. If the Titans go great, I lose. How dare you make me question feelings about the Titans. 
Weak ass shit
Ghetto ass shit
Give it a few 
Fucking ESPN hasn't registered it😂😂

You for sure need an enclosed trailer to keep the trophy safe
i’m thinking i’d go with a 24 foot enclosed. if you don’t have room to park it at your house you can keep it over here
I’m going to look at trailers today. I have acquired so much in the past week that I now need to get a trailer. When I told crystal this she said “yeah u can rent one from uhaul”.  I don’t think she understood what I meant about getting a trailer. 12’ or 14’ ??

The reason why @Christopher Lynn Rangel is silent
null
I would have Benched Diggs. Who is she?
That’s who I would have started 
Man!!!  Kupp - Cousins would have been a killer duo this week
null
😳
The grass wasn't cut low enough 
Wind speed was a little high 
null
The humidity levels weren't right 
Didn't think kupp would be used much since he has to fill in as punt returner cause other guys are hurt
Thought the defense would shut down cousins and sack him since the o line is shit
Why!!!! Why football God's!!!!! 
🤣🤣🤣
Fuck!!!!! 
I thought too damn hard that's my fucking problem

That is some really good bench depth @Christopher Lynn Rangel

Line starts here. I've been trying to get that handy since it still would've been statutory rape.

Front of the line
I'll get him to use both hands
Before Cody gets one
For the love of God yesssss
Yes I'll get Wes to give you a handy
You want me to go in there and commissioner that shit?
I'm. Not having fun
I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣
Chris' bench points look like Wesley's cholesterol - through the roof. 
 God please let it happen 
😭😭😭
Please let me. Revert back to having cousins and kupp in there
He is. I like him. 
He’s a nice guy tho

He has....i agree
Golladay has been a stud 
It was a generous offer is all 
Just need a running back without trading a running back away
No.....why do you say that?
@Nathaniel Collier do you know something I don't know?
Although, if you had accepted that bet last night, it wouldn't have cost you as much.
@Andy Rangel  pussied out of the trade he verbally agreed to earlier.@Brian O'Cain  is a real man.
I approve of this decision
Todd, let's collude and combine our teams and we'll split the winnings.
the only other person with more points against is@Todd Wiencek

Those beards will be on fire soon 
"Doesn't feel magical tonight" lol
he's back
lmao
He did it again 
😂😂😂😂
Holy shit
haha[
That was roughing the sacker. All of big Ben was on top of that guy 
And there is the Fitz we all know and love
man this body weight call is stupid
lol what the fuck is with tampa's WRs just getting wide fucking open
AB!!!! 
AB
Fuck yeah baby
@Christopher Lynn Rangel  we buying that
Out there running like Forrest Gump

That fool thought he was in a field or some shit
null
dumbass ran into the wall hartd

Vance McDonald stiff arm

🤔
I’m gonna hire a bodyguard to carry it around everywhere and protect it when I win it this year. 
I rest my case
🤣🤣🤣
I definitely didn't do that.
And did you or did you not solemnly swear to protect it at all costs
But I helped build the new one. 
There was a football broken off of it. Correct.
Did you.. or did you not give Nick brown a broken ass trophy 
I'm not avoiding it @Nick Brown is avoiding it. 
😳😳😳
@Cody Alexander  avoiding the trophy topic 
The trophy 🏆 is taken care of.
You didn't take it with you did you? Shameful 😔
👀👀
😐 umm you should have bought a case for the original trophy 🏆 to keep it at your house. I ended up with a broken ass trophy.
So 21.1
No @Brian O'Cain the bet was that AB would score enough to beat NB if he sat his qb
So I'm assuming you bought some sort of case for the trophy? 🤔
We will be there @10
null
@Nick Brown are y'all driving or flying?
null
@Justin Rossano are you seeing this shit?
What is that number? @Wes Young 
So the bet is if AB don't score enough points to beat NB, 
No balls
Wow
null
I give you $10
Lol it's a hard bet to commit to 
@Wes Young @Brian O'Cain 
I don't think he is.
He ain't about it 
null
@Brian O'Cain said he was in but is he really really in?!? 
?
@Christopher Lynn Rangel @Andy Rangel are you seeing this?
null
null
null
And if I win you give me Zeke for Alfred Morris? 
Ooooooooo @Brian O'Cain said he ain't no bitch @Wes Young. Are you about it?!? 👀
I am in 
@Wes Young @Brian O'Cain DO IT! I want to see this shit happen!!!
Ooooooooo @Wes Young ain't about that life. He scared. 
🤔
@Nathaniel Collier isn't even a fireman anymore @Nick Brown. You definitely can't trade him to that Judas mofo.
If AB don't score over 20, we trade Crowell for AB 
$10 on AB scoring enough for me to win if he sat a QB, so basically 21.1
How much on that side bet 
Lemme see them nipples
I bet he could drop Fitzpatrick and play Winston tonight and still win 
@Nick Wayne 
I miss when you used to participate
@Nick Wayne where are you
🤷‍♂️
I'm just over here trying to get some side money 
Congrats on the easy win @Nathaniel Collier  you the real MVP
Hey i believe @Cody Alexander is right @Nick Brown .....but if you trade him....at least trade him to someone that respects your position at CFD.....so basically im saying not Cody
Rivalry week? 
Easy $10 
Come on
Anybody want in on a side bet? 
null
Or side bet! I'll bet you $10 on AB scoring over 20 points 
@Nick Brown are you scared? Just sit him
@Nick Brown your heart (and hands) are about to be full with that baby girl. So full, in fact, that you won't be able to love her and Gurley. I will take that burden off of you. I am here for you. 😍😍😍
@Wes Young That wouldn’t matter. 
Hey @Nick Brown you might want to sit your QB in celebration
@Nick Brown Did you have Crystal call you daddy yet?
Lol
@Nathaniel Collier There is all kinds on POT. 
Congratulations @Nick Brown!
Hell yeah brother, @Nick Brown , take your time. Dont worry about that roster either....you got bigger fish now

Did you sell your soul last night? I woke up and the bears D and White got you like 35 points! This is some brown magic kinda shit.
I can still win too I just need Juju and Desean to get super pissed off and get ejected from the game at right after kickoff 🙏🏽

Wes would convert and be Super Hood
Kinda the same result. Either they go white, or they crack out, die and the whiteness prevails.
No no.....they will want to wash the whiteness off of them....they will go straight to the hood and shoot up heroin with a dirty needle. 
I wanna be so white, they go shop at Gap afterwards 
I'm really stoned and having a blast
@Justin Rossano , it does not affect their blackness......you will just be considered an albino whitey.

What if you’re super white like me? Does it affect their blackness?
Ohhh come on @Wes Young ....im from Detroit and i go back every year. Its not that bad....as long as you like being the grain of salt in a pepper shaker

@Wes Young .....thats really not throwing shade....sadly its the truth....but in actuality.....they need a fuckin offensive line. Barry did all that magic with trash linemen....just think if he had a bad ass line....he would had done even better
Blount looking good
Said they've been looking for a running games since barry sanders

I talked to Chris for 4 minutes last night about the trade and he mentioned getting a new truck 46 times. 
True, only seen that hit 
It's the best 
bad part is I don't see the titans because they never score...
@Brian O'Cain  I love redzone

@Nick Brown  keeps liking my posts. I'm not really sure why
I need kirk cousins to sling this shit now
No one on the planet thought that would be happening.
Never thought they would be blowing out the Vikings to be honest 
Just think - if someone had done rivalry week this week they would've given Josh Allen and thought it was genius.
@Nick Brown  is still losing though
Good
lol it's likely
I hope you go 0-12 this year 
Josh Allen has 25 pts@Christopher Lynn Rangel  how many does Cousins have?

He's acting like I just didn't show - I called that fool this morning.
Lord have mercy......Unreliable Alexander
No Cody here. You seen him?
What you mean? Did @Cody Alexander  not show up? Wtf man......but im a terrible friend?
Sure did. But when you were the FIRST friend I asked and committed, I didn’t bother asking any others.
Didn't you make new friends in Brentwood?
@Nathaniel Collier 😂
What’s a more terrible friend, saying you can’t help from the beginning? Or being committed to help then bailing 15 minutes before you’re supposed to show up?
Let’s ask this question:
Me looking for @Cody Alexander this morning 
Fucking traffic sucks 
God @Andy Rangel .....Cody and Justin waiting on your ass. Been working 2 hours already
Getting off at Spring Hill exit now 😬
Breakfast
@Cody Alexander ......how was breakgast at Rossano's? You lucky bitch
Second @Cody Alexander @Nathaniel Collier damn
First @Justin Rossano thank you for considering my hands 
I went night night before all this happened.

Hell it may not be a win this time. We have to wait until fucking Saturday to let the stat corrections come through and see if any of our players get a correction.

So you're terrible @Cody Alexander ...trying to make me feel bad. 
@Justin Rossano I don’t even know what to say to that 🤦🏽‍♂️

I wasn't invited. 
I asked him if he was off Tuesday, he said no, I didn’t go any further 
Even more terrible
Terrible? I dont even know whats going on...

@Andy Rangel You're
@Andy Rangel   You’re*
@Nathaniel Collier You suck and YOUR GAY 
lol.....can i have my normal qb's now lol
My calculator has been glitchy lately 
Fucking rivalry week! Geez. That is incredible.
Per our scoring system, it cannot be any closer 
Thats about as close as you can fucking get right there. 
There could be a stat correction.
However, we need to monitor these yards, until they make any final adjustments 
Fucking Gabbert got me
@Nathaniel Collier basically you lost by .04 that happens to be half the illegal limit 
Holy shit.
Nate lost by one yard passing.
null
null
Final score with the calculated yardage:

Cody: 100.22
Nate:100.18
Numbers are as gay as @Andy Rangel 
Numbers are hard.
Lol.... @Dylan Pine ....i hate math. 
Nate’s QB points
I will let you guess who's is who's 
jerk rn
Cody’s qb points
100.22 and 100.18 
So.....with all the totals added up.....my score is what.....and codys is what
null
null
It's actually off of total score. To break it down even further, you can calculate the qB yardage 
No. The whole starting lineup with the math done from the QBs actual scores. 
We are only going off the qb's score? 
null
It is in the constitution that QBs score .25 per passing yard yes.
Is that in the constitution? 
QBs score .25 per passing yard. No need for a tie breaker. Just do the math. 
@Cody Alexander 
@Cody Alexander must be doing his bench points math before agreeing
Thats ok with me i guess....
I am with Justin 
How about we add up total points, plus bench points???
The QBs have scoring to the hundreths
Well i will say.....it was a crazy football weekend especially with the rivalry stuff
By the math I won by .04 @Brian O'Cain just verified it.
Not sure. There’s nothing in the constitution about a tie. I will work with @Wes Young to resolve this
@Justin Rossano @Wes Young ......so whats the procedure for ties....
Mortal kombat
Fuck that.....no rock paper sissors....how bout a game of chess.....or call of duty....lol
null
Me neither. How bout we take points from our normal starting qb.....and put them into the score....
null
Lol I don't know...
@Cody Alexander ......so whats up?
Wow 
Well we both go to 100 no?
Because it's rounded up or down 
Now which one of you would please have the higher exact score
DISSLY.......WHOOOOOOO
Come on Marshall! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
bullshit
So did dissley
Yeah he did. 
fucking lockett showed up in the 4th
Throw it to lockett the rest of the way
Nope
Nopr
Well he should lose more trick
He did fool. Then I was 1 point down and he caught a ball for 5.
Howard should lose points for losing yards. 
Fucking bullshit
I knew they said that was a five yard catch but they only gave him 4.
null
Lmao.....
Pics or it didn’t happen

Per the announcer, Wilson is elusive and slippery 😲
he looks like he probably will
I just need Russell Wilson to get 88 more points and I’m good 
Only good thing that came out of it was Justin rooting for my team
Don't know whose idea that was but man that was fucking stupid

Flex bros and tiny shirts for life

Your score is toast dude

@Nick Brown leave muh high score alone damnit 😭😫😭
I appreciate it 
@Cody Alexander , you are welcome for picking you a qb that actually got points. 
@Brian O'Cain please leave my single game score alone 😔😔😔

It's fun but hurts 
Diggs went OFF today!

Dak Attack baby

Fuckkkkkk
Dammit Justin 
Switch this back 
Gosh dammit justin
I fucking hate you
😱😱😱
Kirk Cousins with 46.5
@Brian O'Cain why?
I should of played cousins 
Man this is fucking insane
@Brian O'Cain has two QBs that could combine to beat me 
@Justin Rossano  what the fuck
@Justin Rossano  🤷‍♂️
@Christopher Lynn Rangel You see this?!?!?!
I will probably be right there with you
null
Cut your grass
I wonder how many times I scored over 100 last season 
Who would have thought
Two weeks over 100 points and two losses 
Well hopefully I'll stay in the survivor pool 
Damn pussy
He can't go deep
Despite my complaining, I have enjoyed watching Josh Allen play. This was fun.
It would still be a close game if we had started our initial QBs @Justin Rossano 
@Brian O'Cain can you please sit your afternoon players?
Are you big boy???
@Wes Young  I'm coming
Well when your bench has almost as many points as your starting team, you wouldn’t have fun either 
I'm not having a good time
I hate you
@Christopher Lynn Rangel That’s your boy!
Wooooooooooo! Josh Allen with that 2nd INT
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Wants the same thing @Nathaniel Collier 
Bench points 
Can i just get a damn passing touchdown plz
Whose bushit idea was this for "rivals" again? I would had picked pauls ass. 
@Justin Rossano .....my bench points are fire....lol. and im sitting here with Gabbert as my qb....and the titans running wildcat offense 
Welcome to my last season 
My bench points are making me cringe
It’s my only hope 
If dak goes off I'm going to lose my shit
Gosh dammit Justin!!! 
Allen threw a fucking int
Mahomes!!!!!!! 
null
null
Eat a bag of dicks
Holy shit @Justin Rossano

Why do I play fantasy
Yeah
Yep
You ready for me to come over 
Lol
Now I can do other things this afternoon
True 
Cause he is passed you
Well @Wes Young  at least you don't have to watch @Brian O'Cain  slowly catch up to you
And Peterson to stop being old 
Nah, Thielen needs the ball
I need diggs to do something 
Bitch, you got Gordon single handedly fucking the Bills
😫😫
Juju on that beat today
Exactly
Who?
Bye black guy qb who is no longer relevant
😳😱
null
null
Nick Brown with no QB problem
Plz
@Brian O'Cain can I get one of those QBs?
Mahomes!!!!! 
But some fat fuck wanted to hold on the line
Jimmy Graham had a touchdown 
Fuck you cunt ass Matt Ryan rushing it in from the 1 you bitch ass fuckboy...
I just cancelled my gabbert jersey 
Most bench points this week, I got em
Dak with them rushing TD’s tonight. Throw for 1, rush for 1
Mmmmmmm that’s good shit
Dak will do good let me have th8s
Stop it
Dammit ivory
Do it
Put Peterman in!!
Yeah just die already so my defense keeps points 
And why is Josh Allen trying to win?!? 
@Nathaniel Collier your qb choice for Cody is going to directly effect your loss 
You know what’s great.....when your defense loses points because Green Bay blocks a punt for TD. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Dude Ben hates you. You need to drop his ass so you don't have to choose.
Ben is a love hate relationship. Generally, I hate him
Me to Williams and Graham right now.
Mmmmmm, big Ben 
Can I get a new division please?
Dear @Brian O'Cain why didn't you start mahomes?
Please 
Let Allen look good a little bit
I need the chargers to lighten up 
null
Woooooooooooo! I love bench points! Woooooooooooo!
Let's call that td back for Ben please
You have to downfall him
Why can't Allen do that
Tannehill doing good
Le'Veon isn't doing shit 🙄
Stafford gonna go wild today 
I always start the wrong qb. This is why I don't like having two 
Gosh dammit Justin 
😫😫😫
Watch dak go off tonight 
Josh Allen fucking sucks
#toptier

My all star WR core is combined for 4.8 pts

null
I can't believe this. Ben got me again 
Shit I love him 
Dude is on fire man
Dear @Brian O'Cain thank you for not starting mahomes

Fucking love it and I'm not even a titans fan
Corey Davis just laid that guy out 
Nate fucking you
@Cody Alexander  you should of picked gabbert
I have no idea but I am rock hard
Who the fuck are these titans
Vrabel is just smiling 
Lol what are you the Titans doing 
null
Titans snapping directly to Henry just so gabbert can't touch the ball
Can I go put Jackson in?
JK this is fucking awesome 
I'm not havint fun anymore
I feel your pain
The hell is Allen doing 
Damn you Justin 
Muh cousins😫😫😫
Defense is stout today 
Son I'm a kc fan now
Mahomes ain't playing around 
God damn what a trade 
null
Ajayi out already?
Rivers on my bench already has a TD 😭
Dayummmmm
Titans said no qb no problem 
So I should see it soon

Fake punt for TD

Justin barely fulfilling his responsibility
Cody wanting to do as little as possible
Sorry I though he placed him already.
Yeah thanks. Ibalmost vomited when i opened my team
I dropped Luck and Trubisky respectively 
@Cody Alexander .....come on bitch
null
Done
Oh no I'll have to start Brees if you don't attend to it, oh the humanity!
Thats fine. Thanks for fixing mine thought. Appreciated ya @Justin Rossano 
I just don’t feel an overwhelming desire to attend to Cody’s needs at the moment
Well, technically I’m eating breakfast 
Did he say he was "working"? Where you at @Justin Rossano , cause we know Brentwood dont work...
Excuses 🙄🙄🙄
Working shithead. This is the price you pay for bitching out last night up to this point. Now you wait.
Oh my God @Justin Rossano hurry the fuck up! "Why aren't you participating in our bullshit ?" (Bitch voice). Can't even change roster in timely fashion.
null
So intriguing 
I aint scared....Gabbert plz sir
Who you want Gabbert or Mariota? I'll let you pick.
😱😱😱😱
Im down @Cody Alexander .....lets go fuck face
null
null
Cause they announced they are both going to play. It's better than us replacing our RBs with non starters 
Because both re probably going to play 
How we both gonna start qbs from tn?
Are you in?
Thanks bro. 
I'm probably upgrading you from Cam with Gabbert anyway...you're welcome.
😱
LMAO
Naw bitch......sleeping. just resting up for all the football, drinking, and winning im going to be doing today
@Nathaniel Collier confirmed scared.
FUCKING WOW @Nathaniel Collier 
Wow
Faking*
You down @Nathaniel Collier ? Let's go! He's making sleep cause he scared.
Have to wait until at least 9:00
It's too early for that 
Just saying hello 
@Nathaniel Collier has to start Gabbert and I'll take Mariota.
Just to be clear, @Wes Young are you saying hello, or that you’re high?
Hi

Hi 
It's Sunday! 
I'm down for that.
😱
We'll see who wins 
How about one of you start Mariota and the other start gabbert 
Confirmed*
Is he confined to play?
Is Mariota an option? He's hurt. I wasn't looking at hurt players.
@Nathaniel Collier if you have any balls at all start Mariota for him 
It was him or gabbert
Damn I thought about doing that to you but it wouldn't be fair 
Oh shit
I hope he makes you start Mariota
🤤🤤🤤
null
I'm in! Where the fuck you at bitch ass @Nathaniel Collier let's go!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Yes and he can do the same
@Justin Rossano @Christopher Lynn Rangel can I tell him who to sit for who I'm going to pick for him?
Ole jimmy g about to get a new toy 
null
😂😭😭😫😫
“Titans gonna lose today” to the nationwide tune
null
Winston and Mariota 
Bust*
2015 QB draft has been a busy 
null
Gonna bring Peyton Manning in
He could still probably sling it 
If starting Gabbert means getting him killed it's a risk I'm willing to take
What's Brett Favre doing these days ? 🤔
I'd take him
I'd even take the kneeler 
#TeddyBridgewater
Either way I think we'll pick a QB up next week because whoever starts behind this hole of a line is going to be murdered 
They'll never figure it out
Just qb sneak every play 
Just let Adoree play QB for fuck sake 😧

null
Titans fucked up
Luke Falk please come back baby. We didn't mean it when we said you weren't good enough. Please take us back!
Where the fuck is @Nathaniel Collier ?
null
Score high baby
Yes that would suck 
I have to watch @Brian O'Cain chip away at my lead all the way until Monday night 
Shit
Cause of dak
I fucked up.. now I have to wait til tonight to see if I win or lose
That being said gabbert is quite possibly the worst qb in the league 
Ohhhh shit
Holy shit look at that reply 
null
null
@Justin Rossano 
I don't like that all of my players are playing at the same time 
Football day in america... Remember this day.. we have started something great
Get that hammy loose
I just called in a private massage for Fournette  this morning.
I’ve got Lindsay playing at 3:25 also, if I need to swap them
😏
Fournette will be alright 
Nooooooooo
Oooph bad luck on your rbs so far
I’m waiting to see if Fournette wants to play football this afternoon 
Dion Lewis going to get 32 receptions for 19 yards today
And Mariota still "can't quite grip a football"
Mariota not healthy
Titans missing both starting tackles and one backup tackle 
Strong play for Houston D
I have to cheer for Dak to not implode against the Giants
Houston is a good defense play today 
Me too since I have the chargers defense 
Don’t you reverse voodoo your quarterback 
I hope Josh Allen gets angry and throws to the other team
Nick Brown and Dylan in week 4! Wooooooooo
Chris, you hype? I’m hype!
Fisher of men
And I'm a follower
He just goes with whatever everyone else does
When they said you can slot one person into their lineup 
Justin and Chris did 
I didn't make the rules
When did you start making the rules for something you hate @Wes Young ? 🤔
Theo Riddick
Frank gore
You can't tell him not to start only tell him one player to start 
There are no starting RBs to replace Saquon with so I'm out.
Chris, you may want to answer Cody before he cries
I will buddy
Enjoy having no home button or finger print scanner
Sure
Oh my God make it stop
Are you going to get the iPhone Xspqhbd7?
null
@Cody Alexander Right now trying to make a decision 
No Android corrects it too much for my liking
And fat fingers
Don't blame the phone for your lack of spelling ability
@Christopher Lynn Rangel 😍😍😍
I've had too many issues with this shitty piece of shit fun
Have fun 
Going back to apple in a few months 
Mine is correct
IDK fucking Android 
@Christopher Lynn Rangel why does yours still say Luke Falk fan club??
Here we go again 
All I heard was “bitch voice”
null
I'm trying to make this stupid decision make sense. @Wes Young you're not even in shhhhhhhhh.
I am totally down with this format.. bitch voice
Was hype about it then started bitchin
null

I don't hold the hands of bitches
Pretty much 
He can't make a decision without asking 7 people 
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Will you go hold his hand 
Just make a damn move. 
😂😂😂
#scared
Complains relentlessly about my non participation in this fuckery -call to ask advice of who to start for Nate no answer...
null
He called me 2 times last night.

Running my mouth cause it’s not what y’all wanna hear... shit I feel like you been running that mouth solid for the last hour about this dumb shit. 
Hold on.....he has to ask his wife. 
We can take a letter and whoever has a player who’s last name starts with that letter, they get turbo... and we double their points that we... 
null
Who am i putting in
@Cody Alexander ........rival bitch.....
Paul is just running that mouth
@paul said you being a hypocrite
Ooooo
🤔
Shit, I can’t give a Lyft without seeing consistent messages come in from y’all... now it’s “quit typing”
😂😂
Quit typing 
#lets all see who can hold their breath the longest. That person gets to choose who they want an automatic win against... including previous loses
Ssssssshhhhhhh
This is a conversation for people that wanna have fun 
you can’t pick a tat someone in the league already has @Nick Brown 
Quiet peasant 
Leaves the door open for @Cody Alexander versus @Nathaniel Collier 
I have some ideas... #1 let’s draw straws, and whoever loses has to pay double league fee and take an automatic loss
Week 4 tattoo 
i’m down. #notmychief 🖕🏻🖕🏻
True champion
null
@Dylan Pine Week 4 rivalry. Be ready
Go away coward
@Paul Miller
#optoutlivesmatter
@Nick Brown Is in! Just filled him in
So what are we looking into doing?

Leadership from your champion 
Take note @Paul Miller @Cody Alexander @Wes Young 
My niggas!! 
that’s the spirit @Nick Brown 
I’m not sure what’s going on but yes
I had no doubt about you buddy
second place definitely in
You want some of this rivalry action champ?
I really lowered my expectations this year 
There was a glimmer of hope for this league to be awesome
null
null
The rest of the league....
don’t you wish @Wes Young 
null
Can I retroactively make Dylan my rival and change his team from last week?
🤣
@Justin Rossano 😂😂😂
Oh I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say that the players added are not highly sought after
null
It would be a logistical nightmare and what if someone wanted to pick up one of those players?
People worried this game will keep em out of the playoffs 
!ididweekone
#notgonnawinanyways

Bye Felicia!
Don't be a pussy
!changetherulesaswego
Just saying people have gone 0-4 and still won
This is the first time I think I’ve won week one, and y’all suckas just trying to take that shit away. 
null
#truth
How can I lose the first game of the playoffs if I don't make it to the first round of the playoffs
Weak my ass. It’s truth. A lens of bitterness just sees it as weakness...
Neva scared
null
Again, low expectations all around 
Yall crazy.....
I’m already good enough at losing at this... I don’t need help with that. 
Fucking switching sides like a girl in a threesome
@Wes Young  you were just hype about it what the fuck
Weakness 
Ooooooooo @Paul Miller said it.
null
@Paul Miller spitting some truth 
!optout
That’s some dumb shit. You wanna start taking skill outta the game with as much time as y’all put into rules and shit???
The player you drop is off limits from being picked up off waivers 
Just for shits and giggles man
You have a rival. You get to select a player to start on their roster 

Correct look at our qbs
null
So y’all want to assign each other someone where they can sabotage their team by taking away one player for one week right?
😱 
Scared
Can’t believe all these scares bitches
I’m still hype man. 
Crushed a poor boys spirits
Having to try to stay up on this dumb shit
I was so hype for this now I'm just bummed 
Me too @Brian O'Cain I’m out here in deez streets. Trying to make dat money...
@Justin Rossano .....taking Dylan to court? Hell naw. Dont need anymore child support.....be we know who is dat baby pappy
I have missed so much 
I would say we don't need to do it all on the same week to keep some good choices on the wire for it.
No Alfred we will delete the hell out of you
!optout
So we doing this one early week out if the season then
Oh Paul gonna come in now and opt out for this but where was he for will Fuller last year
How many championships have you won @Justin Rossano? Don't worry I'll wait. 🤔
Jesus Christ. Y'all in?
Wes acting like he is gonna go deep into the playoffs 
I opt out too!!
Pretty much. Cody is all of a sudden worried about a loss. Thought he got used to that last year.
I forgot Cody hasn't grouted his floor and needs the league money to sell the house
🤣
Justin I'll still do it with you even though they were just hype about it but talked to their wives and got told no 
So what are y'all terms then
null
I herd dat
I ain't neva scared
Bitches 
A win or a loss has just as much weight in week 2 as week 10
I opt out 
Yeah I agree
Easy for you to say in week 2.
Fine with me then 
Disagree. It’s still one non-conference game 
That's what I was saying maybe just do a set week
We are going to have to shuffle the schedule if we are going to do this. I play @Nick Wayne week 10. Can't be fucking around then.
Lol I ain't @Andy Rangel 
@Nathaniel Collier he is on the phone with Bry right now to see if he is allowed to participate hold please 
@Nathaniel Collier You gonna battle Dylan for baby daddy rights?
null
@Cody Alexander .....sorry Ellen....i am THE jerk....
The face Paul made when he read the thread 
Savage
Oh daamn @Justin Rossano 
Be careful 
Serial killer
Andy’s rival is job security
null
@Justin Rossano 
Where is @Andy Rangel ‘s shit talking ass?
😭😭😭
But @Cody Alexander was right, my only real rival is the first round of the playoffs
I can’t like this enough ☝🏻
Let’s go @Cody Alexander!
Everyone loves me 
I have no rivals
Wes, who ya got? Paul? Andy?
One early week that don't really matter 
I love it 
You damn right!
Yes
Lol is this really happening???
Oh shit!!!!!! 
null
So I had a friend, who was a really good person, that choked the shit out of a mentally handicapped kid at Whites Creek in a fight once. Due to seeing how terrible he felt after - I pick @Nick Wayne if he's down.
I would like @Nick Wayne as my rival because he can't beat me 
And fuck you @Cody Alexander  that was rude 
I just caught up
null
Who is Todd going against 
@Todd Wiencek 
Rivalry week!!!! 
Where is everybody at????
Where is @Wes Young 
Cody, you versus Asian Nick or Andy
But they both need to agree
Paul doesn't get to choose - it's Wes. Come on now.
@Paul Miller Who you wanna go after??
SHIIIIITTTTT I said smart ass not asshole.
Nah. Collier wins easily. You don’t get to be “The Jerk” without earning it
@Andy Rangel vs the magazine?
Me and @Nathaniel Collier for the smart ass award?
No just meant now
You talking about preseason @Christopher Lynn Rangel ?
Yes. As early as possible
Or should we do one early week? 
And need to be toward the beginning of the season. 
Correct 
It's only one game out of the season
@Paul Miller Who’s your rival? Call em out!
@Paul Miller 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂
So far just sounds like not an awesome thing 
Aw naw - y'all getting charged for it. 😐
@Christopher Lynn Rangel You my boy BLUE!
Hell yeah baby!
😱😱😱
@Brian O'Cain vs @Nick Brown  for who should have really got the shift chief job lmao
Also, this does not count as a transaction 
null
Oh shit
I like Wes and himself in the first round of the playoffs. 
Put it in the constitution 
We need to get this on paper
I like Wes and Nate as rivals
@Christopher Lynn Rangel I will go in and manually adjust the rosters now.
Hype as fuck
Shit just got real
I’m dropping Wentz. Same deal
I will make sure nobody does.
Deal
I'm dropping tyrod so no one pick up 
This is the best thing to happen to our league
Alright fuck it get dak
Alfred???
Who does @Brian O'Cain play?
Correct. Has to be a starter
No third string RBs or anything like that.
But it has to be a starter not a questionable player 
You are allowed to pick one player 
For you
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Come on
Can I pick a different qb
hahaha or that
Set em up... I’ll knock em down
could have everyone do it that same week with whoever they play
Dylan and Nate. Battle for paternal rights to Dylan’s baby
Paul
Oh yeah! Wes and Pail!
#twins
Chris and Justin
Wes and Paul
I’m in baby!
Pencil that game in
Who wants some???
But once established, it would be epic! 
Has to be someone who will play.
Establishing a rivalry would be the only difficult part
Has to be done in the earliest game you play if you happen to be in the same division. 
Flex Bros=rivalry
We need to establish rivalry first
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Let’s gooooooo
True. 🤔
The shit talking that took place last year was excellent
Lol why @Nick Wayne ?
Dammit
Cody, your rival has to be @Nick Wayne 
This is brilliant
I’m so fucking psyched right now
That's perfect. You get to add them back for free after the week.
How about you can drop who you need to, but they are off limits?
Rivalry week! Determine rivals and you get to pick a starting player for them. Only once a season though. WOOOOOOOOO!
I ain’t backpedaling 
Only if I don't have to drop anyone 
But but but
Come on. We could be the start of something amazing for this league
Damnit
Stop it Justin 
Dak will go iff
Lol naw I can't 
Im about to go get Dak 🤢
Yes sir
Is Josh Allen starting? 
null
@Christopher Lynn Rangel We doing this?!?!
I am totally down with this format. Brilliant!
null
null
Deal! You play Josh Allen
null
Dak throws for 400 yards and 6 TDs 
Go play dak
Who you want me to start buddy? I’ll let you start one of mine, and you do the same.
At this point they’re all gonna be hurt
And play his hurt people 
You Asian loving bastard there you are !!! How's my alliaance buddy.. go steal Justin's phone for me

What time does the game start 
null
null

@Todd Wiencek is also selling essential oil on the side. 
5 is good with me. You can do it through draftkings but they take 10%
null
@Nick Brown is thinking $1000 a week.
I'm down. But probably for $5. I don't have Captain's money Todd.
If you guys want, I can set up a private DraftKings game every Sunday. If you want to play that week you send $10 (or more less) to my paypal. 100% of the money goes to the winner after the last Sunday night game. I’ve been doing it the last few years and it’s really fun. You get a new team each week. You can also skip weeks that you don’t feel like doing it. I promise I won’t Bernie madoff the money 
My defense is going to go negative tonight.
The only reason I did it is because I have AJ on my league team. 
🤣
I always struggle with starting the lord of gingers at QB..but that big, ugly, rock chuckin, bastard, comes through often 
Don't be bitter bitch @Christopher Lynn Rangel 
Probably should've spent more than a dollar. 
null
I'll be there in the ring 
Lucky 
null
Whose coming with me?
Boyd’s only 6% owned. You might win some cash money homie 
I also played the Ravens D so it evened out for you.
So aggressive. 
Well @Cody Alexander ....i prolly would had punched you in the face for playing Green tonight lol
I'm only winning 5 right now
Awww fuck yeah baby
@Christopher Lynn Rangel @Todd Wiencek look at the top!
Shit man. I wish I would've known earlier. I would come down and see you that's only like 20 minutes from the house.

True story 
Pain is temporary. Legends never die @Nick Brown 
Crystal is currently domestic abusing @Nick Brown for pricing the plane ticket for it.
It was a newborn 😍
The trophy was just a baby there
null
null
Lol 😂 
I have already warned Nicole, when I win it......
You better get a picture of it with the pilot, in the cockpit
It’s for her not me. I’ll just keep saying that when I have to pay the extra 800$ for an extra plan ticket so it can sit beside me
It’ll be a sight for sore eyes down there!
Exactly. 
But your child will appreciate it forever.
Fo Sho. Crystal is gonna be pissed 
Take it by AT&T stadium. They would like to see a championship trophy there again.
Gotta go to Texas!
Is it going to Texas?
More importantly, is this photo going to be pictured with the new baby?
Mayor!  I’m gonna get a pic with the mayor holding it
I’m looking forward to that sweet sweet glow of continuously changing colored lights lulling me to sleep as a enjoy sweet victory!!
Next time someone from the league works on B shift you should have them polish it. 
May get a pic with it at every station 
Can you let it ride shotgun in Car 3?
I’m gonna take it and put it in shift chief office 2morrow. 
@Nick Brown

Precious!!!!
null
Who needs teeth anyway??
@Nick Brown 
Nah, he’s got big money. No need to fool around with meth
null
And meth while you’re at it...
Do the opposite of Cody. Win championships, get money, fuck bitches
👍 
Stick to the plan Nick
I see @Nick Brown has no time for your petty antics.
Yea Cody that was harsh!  
I damn sure ain’t included then...
Hey, you could go get Blount. I just dropped him. He will score more than Bell
Ouch!
This is a champions conversation. You have no place here.
Unless you want Dez
I will let that sumbitch rot and die on my bench before I trade him.
I reference David Johnson
My vote is Dez. 
If Cody trades him, Bell will start the next week
Now we're talking Nick. Finally a deal that makes sense. Send it over.
Ima say Dez!
This is Dynasty league right?
Who plays first....Dez or Bell?
I was thinking 🤔 a Dez <> Bell trade. 
(I type while gently weeping)
Bwahahahaha!!
Don’t be bitter 
Shhhhhhhhh...
And you could have gotten LeVeon for less
@Nick Brown where is Dez playing? 🤔
HA bitches!!!!!!!!!
Damn!  All y’all suckas wanted ole Kenny!!!!
@Justin Rossano could've gotten Desean for $3. 😏
And I’ve always had a way with the ladies too!!!
That looks just like me @Nick Brown !

Unimportant detail.

@Todd Wiencek With 6 RB’s on his roster
@Paul Miller how do you feel about Le'Veon Bell? 🤔
You can totally have em
@Paul Miller Dammit Paul!!!

Now... who wants stills?
Good first waiver day of the season
null
Night night
🤷‍♂️
Does Paul know something we don’t?
And Paul won this week. Madness?
Not even close
Still doesn’t beat $30 for Stills
Hahahahaha! I was thinking of something drastic to say about that one!
Only a broken man pays $11 for a defense. 😔
I never spent that faab last year
I spent that much and got 3 players
Oh my LAWD!
Paul going hard for 4 receptions a game 
Yeeeaaaaahhhhhhhh!

Lol yes
Is*

Dawson is a lineman lol
Barely
hey stafford is finally in the black for this game lay off him 😂😂

Damn
Popped

I wish they could kick field goals like they do kickoffs. 80 yards field goals would be awesome. 
Sweet
Bench points

Season opener
Since when did they start doing two games 
Crowell just fell forward 12 yards
I don't have stafford. I have Alex Smith 
Bryanna just asked who had Stafford and said I bet they're terrified every time he throws 🤣🤣🤣
Also stafford will be on waivers Wednesday
Detroit forgot how to catch 
Oh no - I'm a much better on the organ.

A-A-RON 😍😍😍
A-Aron was ballin out last night
unless Stafford channels his inner Fitzpatrick and gets me 50 points tonight
I still had hope I could pull out a win until that stupid cocksucker A A Ron came back and threw a bomb to Cobb.
@Justin Rossano that's my plan as well
@Andy Rangel

It’s called the @Nick Brown method
Nah, last 2 years I won week 1, and couldn’t finish in the playoffs. Trying something new this year.

null
Packers bout to get down to business
@Todd Wiencek should be the most upset at the Gabbert
I'm in. I'll pick you up in an hour.

My Atlanta fandom is confirmed.
We should form a mob and meet gabbert at the airport
Fox was trying to save us and our spirits.
😭
I've seen enough
Fox had seen enough 
What the fuck happened to the game?
On the real...I look like Vrabel right now
Titans coach looks SAD AF 
Both of them 
Vrabel wants to cry
Take gabberts ankle
You shut your whore mouth
God give us back Walker and take Lewis 🙏🏽
@Todd Wiencek thats what i used to tell @Cody Alexander when i would travel to station 2 to be captain.

@Andy Rangel Is spiraling out of control
Andy's sadness has devolved...
Why did we cut future hall of famer Luke Falk? 
null
🤔🤷‍♂️
Why are both our Heisman winners on the sidelines? 🤔
not perfect scenario for gabbert that’s for damn sure
Fucking gabbert
🤦🏼‍♂️
I'm happy with the Lewis points but isn't this a perfect scenario for Henry? 
null
Gabbert is trying his hardest to lose us this game 
That's a first
That vrabel defense tho
Mmmm 
null
#missedopportunity
That's probably true
🤔😂😂
Waiting to break 50 like 
During the 2 weather delays, the Titans could have signed and flew Jay Cutler to Miami.
Like Luke Falk 
Might want to think about drafting a good fucking quarterback
Maybe a little RPO action
null
They might wanna think about putting that guy in on offense
FUCK YEAH!
Titans still got a little fight in them
MC Beasley was a steal 
IDK who the fuck Jennings is but got damn!!!!
RPO is the NFL version of the Meow game from Super Troopers
I've heard it all weekend 
Is RPO this year's broadcaster buzzword?
null
Titans game going to go to overtime 
My new team name is Helen Keller 
I need Dion Lewis to get one more 
Can we get live footage of you burning it?
@Andy Rangel is out of the pool
Is the magazine dead?

Midnight crew coming into the stadium confused AF wondering why the game is still going on 
Temp agencies super pissed cause they have to pay triple overtime to stadium workers due to weather delay 😂😂😂😭😭😭
😂😂😂
and still threw an interception 
Lol Titans Twitter account is on point
null
🤣🤣🤣
Meanwhile during Titans/weather delay I washed about 4 loads of laundry, rewatched every season of parks and Recreation, managed my cryptocurrency portfolio, took out the trash, assembled a 1500 piece LEGO set, took a nap, visited my next door neighbor, called my grandma, changed out the hub bearing in my work van, illegally downloaded music, created a new account with pornhub, canceled one of my old credit card accounts, went to Lowes, learned how to speak German, returned a Redbox movie, and now the game is about to start again 🤦🏽‍♂️
Back to business next week
I'm just letting @Dylan Pine win since he has a new baby 
Well there is always next century
Fucking cowboys
Kept
Should have kelp Bailey 😂
Naw don't worry Paul dak is going to blow it
Hill and mahomes are killing it 
Well shit... I thought shit talking is what you’re supposed to do... to do your part to win. My team either didn’t show up, or my team just sucks. 
Tailgaters down in Miami super pissed cause their generators have gone through 100 gallons of fuel due to weather delay 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Raining like a mofo too
I'll trade ya
Anybody want dak
🤷‍♂️
They said on the radio titans should start back at 6
null
I hate losing with points on my bench 
@Christopher Lynn Rangel What be Dak doing brah

Titans/dolphins game going to restart at 2 am central time...gonna delay again and will eventually start back and finish early tomorrow morning when everyone is going to work 😂😂😂😭😭😭
Mahomes 😍😍😍😍😍

He’s definitely not coming back until week 10
He looking at Conner stealing that job from him
Le’Veon’s twitter feed after the Steelers game
By the time this weather delay is over Lewan will be totally healed from any injury.
null
PB&J's lol
Titans and Dolphins eating Sunday dinner right now 
Okay
Lmao.....only if you change 3+ players. 
Can we get one lineup Mulligan a year?
"Adrian is the starter. Thompson won't get many chances. Sit him and play Sammy Watkins ."
@Nathaniel Collier Sanders is looking good. Good flex 💪 
We should just eliminate Miami from the NFL 
The person that designed a stadium in MIAMI FLORIDA that didnt make it with a roof should be shot
Everybody getting hurt
What the hell?
It will just get delayed 
None of them 
@Nick Brown - Nick Wayne and Todd
What Titans game are we all going to? #leagueouting

Burning Cleveland down is actually a win for the city of Cleveland...
😂
Mmm bench points 
In their eyes, that’s a win 
Cleveland didn't win but they also didn't lose 🤔
But really 😡
😂
I'll give you that one @Andy Rangel 
Hue Jackson has the biggest set of blue balls right now 
ANOTHER WEATHER DELAY
Whaaaaaaat the fuuuuuuuuck
Blocked
Oh no 
Either way they actually lose
Lmao
They will burn the city down
Oh my God 
Cleveland is going to do it 
It describes my emotional state down to the T 
Bad form 
Over used gif of the day 
Big Ben likes throwing to the other team
Just give the fucking ball to DRAKE
Woooo worth the money 
Fuck yeah Butler!
Butler showed up
Oh shit Titans!!!
Cleveland almost ran back an interception
At least your break 100 @Wes Young 
Titans in trouble
@Andy Rangel I'll be joining you for negative points soon
😂
😂
Ties are for the gays and Kentucky 
Ties are for pussies
Shouldn’t be such a thing 
null
1:44
Cleveland has 42 seconds to make it happen
That game is going to end in a tie 
Pittsburgh just missed the game winning field goal
These refs can eat an entire 50 gallon trash bag of dicks 
🤣🤣🤣
hahaha see him talking shit to those fans going into the tunnel
Wow
WOW
They didn't even address it! WHAT IN THE FUCK!

Nice, cowboys starting the season off with a 4th and 23
I love Lewan so much. 
Dumbass Mariota
Lewan is gonna kill a bitch 
Lewan about to fuck someone in the mouth out there
Look away
But that didn't make it hurt any less 
I'm delayed 
😭😫
Right as he said that.....
He should have stayed out
gabbert!!!
Hahahahaha
Thank God he's back in 
At Mariota
At least I can watch Matt Ryan throw to Julio 47000 times a game and enjoy that
@Justin Rossano it's officially dead now 
FUUUUUCCKKKKKHJJJAHGGGGGHAHHHHHHH
Adoree is in the locker room for evaluation. 
It wasn’t really alive in this game yet 
Run game just died with this stupid fucker in at qb 
At least I don't have to hope for bLaInE gAbBeRt to do something. 
Why does everything I love die?
Blame T-Rac
They don't look much better buddy 
I'm going back to being a Falcons fan for the year. 
Mariota
God motherfucking damnit! BLAINE BITCH ASS GABBERT! WE CUT LUKE FALK! 
And our future is in gabberts retarded ass hands 
😫😭😔
And Mariota hurt his hand 
If/when Pittsburgh loses to Cleveland, how quick do they pay LeVeon?
Cowboys games delayed due to weather 
Or kick returns
Let’s not go there Wes....punt return points for WR’s
I knew I shouldn't have started the chargers defense
Hill is a badass
I could cut glass with this thing
🤣🤣🤣
My dick has been hard all afternoon
Until our own guy tackled him
Cody got a hard dick right now
Hurt his belly 
He gone
Jackson ran into his own guy
Adoree is electric!

Haven't won a game since 2016 lol

Haven't won a season opener in 13 years 
I'm rooting for Cleveland so hard right now 
null
Oh shit it is... That was a crazy game
@Cody Alexander You remember that Saints/Giants game from a couple years ago that went into OT? This saints game is a mirror image
null
No points
Big 
Dammit Lewis cock blocking fucker
Punt return
Hill
Josh Gordon 😍😍😍
I know they keep going for 2 so I don't get the extra points 
I can’t be happy for you @Nathaniel Collier 
Saints are trying to come back. 40-48 now.
I hope the Cleveland game goes to OT so they can not throw it to AB for another quarter
What about Mike Evans with 24 on the board?
😂
Woooo I hope Gore retires before the game starts back up 
@Cody Alexander 😂😂😂
@Andy Rangel 
i’m still waiting
He's about to drop 37 points in @Dylan Pine 
Dion Lewis was reevaluating his life goals during the break. 
Getting ready to start back @Wes Young 
Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse....ZEEK is about to fuck me stupid 😭😭😭
How long does a game have to be delayed before it is just cancelled?
😳
@Andy Rangel Could have Fitz, and it still wouldn’t help
Exactly. 
Next week he will get 4.9 points for 50% of leagues 
Probably started in 0.1% of leagues
Damn man
Fitz with the bonus points
Man Cleveland is giving the Steelers hell
At this pace 
null
Sunday night football will also include the Titans game 
He'll won't combine the next three weeks to have that many points. Bold prediction
😂
Ryan Fitzpatrick currently has 54.3 points. 😳
@Christopher Lynn Rangel they are going to Odell in crunch time
I'm not worried. In 2016 a team started 0-4 and went on to win it all. 
@Dylan Pine what the fuck
🤣🤣🤣
Me all day 
I can tell
I’m just bitter at everything right now 
Fuck off @Andy Rangel . Driving

Bell may have already hung himself 
@Christopher Lynn Rangel 😱😱😱
@Todd Wiencek lemme get Mixon - I'll give you this 👍
null
Mmm mixon living up to his potential 
Can you not say it in such an offensive manner...
Yeah it's called losing
Is there a reward for lowest points scored from Defense? 
🤧
I have really bad luck so don't lose hope 
I think you can only go -4
I have a great shot at losing more points from my defense from the way things are going right now 😂
You still have a great shot. 
🤷🏽‍♂️
He probably will
I’m trusting A-A-RON will give me 6 TDs and throw for over 500 yards 💩
👍🏽
It's okay my defense is only 29 higher than that @Andy Rangel 
It's happening
Lol yay!!!
My defense is -1 🙁
I did not see that score coming
Damn son what the fuck
41-24 TB
Fucking podcast was wrong 
I don't know how to fantasy that's what

Titan's game not likely to resume until 3:15 I heard

I already have $97 bid on him. 
titans game put the baby right to sleep...
I'm picking up Fitz tonight 
Lol
Not until waivers homie... want em?
@Paul Miller , nobody has Fitz....as of right now
It’s Goddell’s fault
Lightning strike was a mile out from the stadium
So they're going to take a weather delay, come back for a minute then have half time...
Wow... Why the fuck didn't they let them finish the half before suspending it 
@Nathaniel Collier Give you Fitzpatrick for em...

Fitzpatrick with 28 already
@Wes Young NO starts slow most years...
@Justin Rossano come on over here and we can watch other games
Good? I don't know but he's always been able to sling it
And what happened to the saints legendary secondary from last year 
When did Fitzpatrick become a good qb?
This Titans game is gonna put me to sleep
Spending all my faab on him 
Mmmmmm picking him up tonight 
Chooo choooo
Yeldon train!!!!
Fournette hurt
😱😱😱
Yeldon tye number one now
Look at Ebron on my bench doin work
Espn clearly broken. AB doesn't have 24 points yet?
Drake is running all over the fucking Titans!! What is going on
Working good here 
Same damn thing. Thought they were 1 in the same....
@Nathaniel Collier it's @Andy Rangel  who doesn't work. 
That's just mean
Mine wasn't either. I had to exit and go back then it refreshed. 

@Christopher Lynn Rangel , you dont even work....how you gonna bitch about your app? That Mexican privilege?

My app ain't working right 
null

@Todd Wiencek , Conner Barth....kicker for Chicago? I mean i can pick him up and we can figure out a trade...
Back to our regularly scheduled football
Should have went with CBS
Shows Collins losing points 
I do want to thank @Nick Brown for the draft day honey. My sons allergies have been almost wiped out completely 
Mine has been acting up too
Any running back is good with Pittsburgh 
I think ESPN is locked up. It shows I only have 2.1
Who is she? 🤔
Le'veon bell? Who's she?
Conner?
I want Conner 
@Todd Wiencek where you at?
AB finally got a catch 
Can I just go ahead and give you the win right now @Brian O'Cain 
Bench points baby
This tenders from McDonald's are the shit
Luck got his first TD 
I almost picked him up twice this week but no one I wanted to drop
Someone dropped him
Nobody has him😱😱

Cousins throwing to the totally wrong guy!!!!!
That's a bullshit call 
@Dylan Pine how's the babe
null
@Dylan Pine Need you to have a talk with your qb...
I'm probably gonna start out 0-1
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Where’s that week one voodoo?
@Todd Wiencek is betting it all on the Titans  
Last year I start out 0-4
@Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Dylan Pine @Nick Brown @Nick Wayne @Todd Wiencek 
@Nick Brown is hiding in shame 
Where the hell is chris hogan?????
Cody just woke up
Where the hell is the rest of the league at?!?!
All in favor to draft at bww next year
Good shit
That b Dubs commercial 😂😂😂
Winston so sucks!
That beard... He's like an old Norse Viking 
LMAO he looks old as fuck 
Fucking crazy
Fitzpatrick gonna take Winston’s job
All the cool QBs are throwing interceptions today 
Fitzpatrick doing work
They're trying to be the falcons 
They have all the momentum, but two red zone trips and only 3 points is a killer
Now the Titans D is just gonna make it easy and give them yards. 
It's cool, don't use Lewis 
What the fuck
What the fuck guys
Missed red zone opportunities 
He could of rsn that in
Not enough dion Lewis though
The offense looks pretty good 
😍 me and Nate on the same wavelength
What the fuck is going on with Mariota? Two time outs 
Wtf is Mariotta doing? Gahhhhh
null
Kamara with 11 points off the first drive...
I gots redzone 🤤
Titans is only game on at noon.....unless you ha e NFL Sunday ticket like the Colliers...ha

Do we have to most basic stadium in the NFL?
null
Royce it is... I just tried to change it with one minute left, and Jarvis is already locked. 
Royce 
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Do I start Jarvis Landry or Royce Freeman at Flex??
Does YouTube tv have NFL Network and redzone?
You tube tv has it!
Dolphins stadium is about 30% full
Guess I'm watching redzone 
That's fucking stupid 
I have a national fox not local 
So my guide is correct
Wow 
null
Yeah, that’s weird. We have DirecTV, and it’s the only noon game on
I'm using PS Vue tv. But it shouldn't be any different
Hmm 
My guide has it on there 
It’s fox 
Anyone know what channel Titans are on? It says fox but the guide shows fox playing something else 
Mmmmmmmmmmm

@Christopher Lynn Rangel  Where you at?? Time to pay the piper!!
null
@Justin Rossano you fancy motherfucker 
Todd Glen is jealous 
How super white people get ready for Week 1
I heard this morning @Nick Brown promised to let Todd Glenn set his lineup for today 😏
@Todd Wiencek  is ready to go, he's just busy setting his 247 daily fantasy lineups
HOT TAKE- @Todd Wiencek isn’t really in the league. It’s a team managed by John Carolan, as proven by his inactivity 
HOT TAKE - Lamar Jackson if going to prove his worth today. Will be starter by week 8.
HOT TAKE - @Nathaniel Collier will drop mutiple players on his team to pick up more Lions players thinking it's a "revolutionary strategy"
HOT TAKE - @Brian O'Cain's fantasy football robot app will become self aware and attempt to kill him - we will replace him with his son Colton in memorium 
However, a most unfortunate situation for LeVeon
You're welcome humanity
HOT TAKE - Now that David Johnson is off Cody’s team, he will be league MVP this year, and cure cancer 
HOT TAKE - Le'Veon Bell was actually in Marquise Pouncey's luggage and will rush for 230 yds and 3 TDs...
Where are you bitches at???
What’s the “hot takes” for week 1?
Who’s going out of the survivor pool this week???
I think we very well may have did the last year with our CBS stint.
It may give us perspective when we go back to Espn 
We really need to look into what the shittiest fantasy platform is, then go with that one. It’s only fitting for the league
We should've went with CBS 🙄
I already locked mine in for that exact reason
I meant 👇 but now ☝️
@Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Dylan Pine @Justin Rossano @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Wayne @Paul Miller @Nick Brown @Wes Young @Todd Wiencek @Christopher Lynn Rangel 👆 We all know this is true

When he’s talking bout hatin crackas... I caint git with dat. 
Paul Paul Paul...I had so much respect for your rap taste. That Pusha track is one of the best diss tracks that's ever been recorded.
Some of his stuff is catchy... sometimes he just sounds like a bitch
And drake is always hit or miss with me. 
null
@Cody Alexander  Just listened to those three songs. 
Didn’t like Pusha T at all...
Damn
Yeah you missed it
Has the Kaepernick commercial came on yet?
How are you still awake?
That was a catch sorry bud 
Come on no catch
Julio is 🔥🔥🔥
I’m tuned in now just in time for halftime...
Yes yes flags
You get a flag
Jesus fucking christ
Refereèing*
Fucking Oprah out there refereeing
You get a flag and you get a flag! You're all getting flags!!!!
That's a solid plan
I'm just going to get stoned during half time and hope everything works out 
Ruin it just like the goshdamn kneelers...
Let’s just play flag football
Come on down fall 
And fumble 
I need an interception 
This overprotective QB bullshit is gonna ruin the NFL
Woo...you almost got them safety points @Christopher Lynn Rangel

I was told their would be points 
Thought Ryan blew out that knee for a second 
Jones just hurt his toe
No need to worry my friend 
Don't worry eagles are chipping away at it
@Christopher Lynn Rangel  Them defense points look scary right now. 
Water break!!!!! 
That is fuckin awesome
Hey 
Hi Paul 😁😁
Sup folks?
Andddddddd he is gone
They we're just letting sproles and Clement open for the main event 
Yay ppr
He has as many reception points as he does yardage lol
They are getting a rhythm
Hey Nick, just throw to agholar
Two yards cody
Mmmmmm talking about Blount
Look look he got a yard!
Wow fake to ajayi and pass for 1 yard 
Exactly @Wes Young 
Maybe that's ajayis role here but they just can't get to the goal line 
Blount is the goal line vulture in Detroit  
😂😂😂
He's not playing football either - that doesn't help me

Apparently neither will play this weekend
You want Jay Ajayi?
I’ll give you defending Super Bowl champ Legarrette Blount
Also, anybody want Le'Veon Bell? 🔔🔔🔔
R/fantasyfootball is in shambles 
I'm going into the season with the 1st overall pick of the draft not playing football - go fuck yourself.
I'm going to go into Sunday with two players not scoring anything
😂😂😂
Atlanta D was a good pick @Christopher Lynn Rangel 
Eagles are a second half team 
Who laughing now beotch
And they made fun of me for picking them 
Jesus Christ
Stingy D
Mmmmmm defense
null
Keeping those legs fresh for week 10 
Sack that ass
Ajayi has been in on one play 
Why the fuck is sproles taking my touches
😂
.2 - he lost 3 yards 🙄
If you lose by .03 we can reevaluate
null
Could have been backward - I honestly don't remember if it was or not.
If anything it will be a stat correction by Tues
Reception for loss should still count I think
May have been a backwards pass?
Something interesting - Coleman caught two ball - the big play, and the loss. He's only got credit for one reception. I'm assuming that's because it's was a play for a loss? @Wes Young @Justin Rossano 
That rule leaves a lot of wiggle room 
I feel like we need get a league flag football Game going during the season 👀
That looked like a busted play
@Cody Alexander Coleman a sneaky bastard 
AYEEEE 😍😍😍
You my boy 
Matty Ice
Where yo boy at???
Watching the game
@Justin Rossano Where you at Kat diddy 👀

Why didn't Meek do the anthem?
Y'all see that 
Lol why is Matt Ryan's forehead so red?
Boys two men just got stuck by lightning 
(slowly standing up)
@Cody Alexander stop kneeling 
The Falcons have a rap history. Remember 2 years ago when they had Future on the sideline during the playoff game against the Seahawks because Future had a baby with Ciara who Russell Wilson was engaged to. #savageasfuck
😂
Is this the Kaepernick commercial? 🤔
Aww fuck yeah venom 
I'll be releasing my official diss track on sound cloud tomorrow
He just said game 1 of 256...
Disrespectful as fuck
You don't diss luda

It was garbage
Much better than revival though.

the ringer is pretty good as well as the track with Joyner
MGK did go hard. Eminem is old but he's one of the best. Haven't finished the new album but the first 3 songs were alright.

Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon.
Probably not.

Offer him the board bitch spot next year.
🤢🤢🤢
Nah I ain't taking no pic with him
Thank God.
You can be the "Smokin' Jays"
Negative
Tell him you will devote your fantasy team to him this year if he lets you take a picture with him.
Is Le'Veon Bell there smoking with Cutler? 🤔
Maybe just have him shoot Le'Veon a quick text you know...
I'm working on it
Did he burn his Nikes?
Can we do a google hangouts with him right now?
Ask him how he feels about Kaepernick
@Christopher Lynn Rangel we're gonna need a pic.
You know that motherfucker does crack
Ask him to share some of his crack cocaine with you
Ask him if he knows the muffin man.
He and Nate can just be bitchy all the time together.
I'd he too though if they had fucked up getting me my range 
I would be disappointed with anything else 
Yes yes...he will fit right in.
would you expect anything else?
That makes me happy
Legit seems like a asshole
See if he knows when Le'Veon will be back. Asking for a friend.
Ask him if he would like to be in the league!!!
Does he want to be in the league?
I told him I dropped him in my league last year 
null
Definitely not smiling 
Ask him what brand of cagrattes he smokes.
Smoking
Is he smiling?
Just him and his wife here

So he's quitting the NFL to be a rapper?
Day 2 of Le'Veon Watch - coaches believe they saw him in the weight room at the facility this morning but when they went in to talk to him he hissed and scurried away on all fours.

Don't steal him from me guys I need all the help I can get 
Me too - $57 bid...good luck

And so it begins 
Of course 😔
null
Oh I be makin moves. I done warned Chris. I’ll have a whole new team by the end of this!
@Christopher Lynn Rangel you should be ashamed letting Todd spend more money than you on waivers! 😔 @Todd Wiencek thanks for contributing the first transaction fee of the year!
Lol yes...you are correct. Just checked. He’s on my roster. Good night everyone, I’m sorry and I’m an idiot 
The bidding ends every night at 10 PM Tuesday thru Saturday. So if you did it before 10 tonight - it would've let you know at 10. I f you did it after 10 you will know if you won it Tuesday night at 10.
Ok. I bid zero. When do I know if I got him? It probably told me before I hit submit. If so I’m sorry..
When you pick someone up on the waiver wire there will be an option to bid. You can bid whatever you want from $0 to $100 dollars. You get $100 dollars a season to use for the waiver wire. 
I dropped Ted ginn jr today, to add a kicker. I was asked my bid price! I don’t give a shit! I’ll take any kicker who’s starting. How does that work?
Gotta hang on to Johnson for now. Mixon’s my only  back worth mentioning 
I got a kicker with your name on it @Todd Wiencek 
Gronk and Walker are on the board
@Todd Wiencek Cole B spit 🔥🔥🔥
How do you feel about David Johnson? 🤔
I got Deandre Hopkins up for sale I need a RB
Thanks to everyone with a hand in getting the app built out today!

Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.

Then he tells you he’s Tyrone 
Tyrone is the baddest dude of all time. He was walking backwards when he bumped into the dude at the beginning of that video! Imagine a buck ass black dude, walking backward down the street.  He accidentally bumps into you. You’re all like “I’m sorry”....I feel like such an A&$-H@%€# my bad. Then he beats your ass in front of your kids

I feel like my my last message needs some context. My family was watching $100,000 pyramid (celebrity edition). We all agreed that Ken Marino (viewed above) reminded us of Brian O’Cain. We googled Ken Marino. We stumbled across a bunch of hunky firefighter pictures and celebrity headshots of this Marino dude! My family has cracked the case. Ken Marino is Brian O’Cain with makeup and good lighting. 
Did I ruin this group with gayness?
When did they take this pic O’Cain? Ya sexy bastard
Looks good man
Mmmmm butcher paper
Foil, could not find paper 
Mmmm bend
Did you wrap in butcher paper or foil?
Don't forget to trim. I cooked 9.5 hrs. Should have been about 14 to 15. I turned temp to 250 to Finnish it faster 
How was the bend on your slices?
Mmm it's happening
I used a Texas rub. The rub is a little spicy. Cook between 200 and 225 until internal temp hits 165. Wrap and cook until internal in 203 
Cool cool cool @Brian O'Cain  good talk 
Rub, temp, time, wind, etc
Give me details my man 
I'm going to go to Kroger tomorrow and buy one 
Aww baby

Getting that beef ready 
Brine it in a bucket. 
The turkey I did following Alton browns method was the best I'd ever had.  
null
Did one few years ago 
Spatchcock it
I probably would split it in half if it is a really big one 
Smoked the breast before. Should be the same as a large chicken 
@Justin Rossano is going to go to work tomorrow with no eyebrows
null
Anyone here smoke a turkey? I'm really wanting to try one. Should be just like a big chicken. 
My father in law got a large stainless steel tank and said he might turn it into a smoker for me 
LMAO this one has an office attached 
null
i think he bought a piece of land in franklin to keep it on
I don’t have Scott’s money either 
Nah, nowhere to put it
He loves it. It makes way more smoke than the little electric ones 
you still need a trailer smoker @Justin Rossano 
We bought my dad a propane smoker for Father's day and I really like it. 
Just need a propane and wepp be set 
It is man. They marked it down $200
I have my Weber kettle and now the pellet smoker
null
That's all he next thing I'll have to buy. My deck is too small for all this 
It's pretty. @Justin Rossano 
Picked up that Weber this morning. Already have a smoker. Needed a new propane grill and couldn’t pass up the deal on this one.
So my wife's family can stop fucking up the turkey at Thanksgiving
They were on sale at Kroger for 1.99 a pound. Bout 2. One is about 20 lbs 
I want to try a turkey 
I'll do one soon. I bought some spare ribs yesterday. 
Brisket is easy
So much money 
Ditto
I'm too scared to do a brisket

The 340?
It's the regular. Guy I work with has the larger one and he really likes it. I didn't think I would need the bigger one. 
Buy your pellets..
I'm just here like
null
What size do you have @Brian O'Cain 
Lol I'm all in. They dropped as low as $150 last year 
You still the real MVP O'cain
True 
That's accurate you control it with a knob 
It does not take the fun from me. I control my grill 
Our founding fathers of time past had no electric grills 
Can you call yourself a grill master if it's electric and it does the work for you
Should have let me know. Sam's had them for 299. 
Cheating 
I'm not sure I agree..just takes the fun out of smoking 
Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous? Are you single ?
That's a great endorsement. Last year at end of season Walmart put most of their smokers on huge discounts. May have to grab one 🤤
If mine broke, I would by another 
I like my electric because I don't have to tend to it at all but it's pretty shitty with producing actual smoke
Not at all. It's just consistent. Food is great 
Does it take the fun out of smoking by doing all the work for you?
It's not a Webber, but I really like it 
Is it everything you ever wanted?
They really interest me 
How do you like the pellet smoker?
Now it's on
😂
It's on top of the grill so that's accurate 
It's on.... 
Y'all down for a game of tag

Eddie George still jacked...
so for me the cost is one small dent

That range is 2,500
Let me ask and see what the price is
None of this microwave bullshit 
mmmmm want a gas range and an actual vent Hood 
@Christopher Lynn Rangel also I need an air filter and water filter for my fridge. Dad said he'd check. Like two months ago 🙄
@Christopher Lynn Rangel Where’s the price at? Not the sticker price. Let me get that “family” discount
I'll tell my dad I want one 😎
Nice 
We have gas here. That thing is beautiful
God I want a gas range 
How much is the stove?!?!
I need one for my house but don't wanna fork out the money for it...

@Andy Rangel ? You sponsoring the mandatory beginning of draft shots this year?
I'm related and still can't even get rain x
I'd get a car wash from that company if they bought me a shot
Those shots will be sponsored by ThreeSixty Mobile detailing I heard...

I just like to bitch 
You know I wouldn't miss it 😘
@Wes Young I agree. In person is better than online. Thank you for understanding, after getting an explanation 
Even it it is at a shitty bar 
In person or gtfo
I suggested Applebee's 
I'm just the league groupee
Look there are only a few people who do off season work on this league. This offseason it was @Wes Young @Justin Rossano @Nick Brown, myself, and @Andy Rangel. Andy found the place and spoke to the owner and set up a location. That's what we should do because hes already set it up. Furthermore we have all agreed since the beginning of this league that our one rule is that you attend the draft in person. That will remain in place or we can replace people. 
We could always online draft since where everyone wants it to be is different and sounds like everyone is married to a place... this would keep someone from having to go and input all the picks...
Everyone will be attending to the best of my knowledge 
Y’all need to figure out how to auto draft at a live draft for those not attending 
Request there and in paylocity 
@Todd Wiencek 
The request form is at the bottom of the calendar.
I looked at the calendar yesterday and that day is still available. Nothing’s been set up for time off requests on A shift yet though 
At Dolan’s now. Who’s joining me?
What the hell? 
I tried to call him this morning and talk to him about that 
Is @Todd Wiencek even off?
null
null
@Wes Young will meet you there.
Anyone want to go to Dolans tonight? 
Killer ratings 
They have one in Antioch 
It just opened 
Why am I just now finding out about this bar? 
🤣
Asking for friend 
So will we have a private room at Dolan's 
Perfect

@Andy Rangel I'm glad we're going to Dolans. Thank you for organizing it for all of us, even the ungrateful ones. You the real MVP.

WOOOOOOO Dolan's!
Sorry. Too busy
I'm just ready to eat my hangover burger and wings at dolans and listen to Carrie Underwood wannabes sing
lay it out for everyone
If you don’t understand......call me
but was it though?
I made a decision, for the good of everyone. 
null
True. The great veto war was serious. It got real!
You didn't even want to go to dolan's you flip flopping bastard
Anyone who bitches about Dolans 
if we made it through that, this is nothing.
@Brian O'Cain  you didn't go through the great veto war of 2016
I'm setting this date, as the date the league of low expectations started falling apart
Bring em @Brian O'Cain 
null
@Christopher Lynn Rangel  and I will be drafting at twin peaks eating ghost pepper wings and looking at titties.
Cigars ate back in?! 
ALFRED IS MAKING HIS OWN DECISIONS!
Mutiny!!!!!!
Old Chicago it is.
Mutiny
Well show up somewhere other than Dolan’s and draft 
😂😂😂
It's out of my control
I won't
Please make the change
Fuck Twin Peaks.
Yep. It’s at Dolan’s

The 2018 Draft will be held at Jonathan's Grille in Cool Springs at 6:00 PM on August 24th.
!draft
but dolan's doesn't have anything that the other places have
Nah I gotta eat and draft at the same time 
Or we can go there beforehand 
null
Can I get some cheese bites?
Anyone interested in splitting a order 
With some ghost pepper wings 
Im going to Uber eats me a hangover burger from twin peaks to dolans 
Draft day is coming! 
Soooooo... Jonathons?
Sorry. Call if you want more
that's not a very good reason though.
It*
There’s more reasons 
Because i was a dick move to cancel on them and throw Andy under the bus like that 
would that be a good compromise?
instead of multiple?
can I just have one reason
Then you don’t want it bad enough
I would like further clarification but I don't want to call.
League draft is back at Dolan’s for multiple reasons. 6pm. If anyone has an issue or needs further clarification, please call me, and I will explain.
😔😔😔
@Todd Wiencek still working on the 24th. 
She was pro about it 😍
I still say we celebrate that birthday after 
@Andy Rangel Was she okay with everything?
null
Sorry Andy, I was down with Dolans. I don't know what to do with all these cigars now. 
Well the owner from Dolan’s followed up just now...told her we had to cancel 🤦🏽‍♂️

What does the league think about this decision? 👀
Then it’s centrally located, so if you wanna go somewhere after to celebrate, we can
I agree man. It’s a chill place, plus the private room 
Johnathon’s is pretty good 
Just talked to the chick there. Gonna lock it up on Thursday with the GM
We can draft, then go celebrate Andy’s birthday
Just called Jonathan’s in Cool Springs. They have a private room, that we can use. Happy hour from 3-7. Food is awesome there. Tons of beers. Great atmosphere 
DECISION MADE!
Lol a bunch of snooty European dudes bumping into each other and making snood comments 
I hate Fiat fights 
Fist. Not the little gay car
Getting dangerously drunk at Applebee’s and screaming a bunch of vulgar belligerent football nonsense might be something to consider. We are guaranteed to get in a fiat fight. That’s always fun

Dave and Buster's
On the 10 yard line

Hangover burger is the shit
Mmmm
I like twin Peaks because the food there is delicious 
I'm down for a house.
Hell yeah flex bro

We also need to draft somewhere that has good service so I can check shit on my phone

I thought thats what we were supposed to do..fuck
Exactly
Wes will never make a move on dem titties. Just gonna stalk in a creepy way, kinda the way he does on my Facebook

Sooooo twin peaks..cause that's right off 65

I may be out stepping my boundaries with this comment. If so, words can’t express my remorse. Has anyone considered the idea of having it at one of our houses? I personally hate bars. Also, fuuuuuuck y’all

Never forget the great battle of 1918 where this league laid it's foundation
The league draft was founded 100 years ago on the corpses of this country 
FUCK IT LETS JUST GO TO DAVE AND BUSTERS @Justin Rossano 
I was bitching about Dave and Buster's because I was losing twin peaks 
@Brian O'Cain You bite your tongue
What the fuck why would you say other wise 
I only suggested Dolan’s because y’all were bitching Dave and Busters 
The league draft is a very big deal sir

Bdubs! 
Omg y’all are making this a bigger deal than it is 😂
Twin peaks wooooooooo
All in favor for old Chicago?

I really don’t care where we go...just let me know soon so I can verbally cancel our spot at Dolan’s 
You’re not gonna get any of that at Dolan’s
Commissioner and co-commissioner can veto and overrule
How could you say no to this

I’m saying Nick! This is my first time of the day to fire this thing up...
Me catching up on the leagues GroupMe 
Thinking about his fantasy football season 
Woooooooo puff puff pass wooooooooo
This is yalls future captain 
If Cody were the bum in the scenario he would have used the money for 

a) more cigarettes
b) a new AC
c) worthless junk food 
d) league fees 
Boom
Plus the original value of merchandise 😎
A $30 
I believe the bum bought a pack of Marlboro Reds, a Colt 45, used the change to buy a condom from the gas station bathroom, took a bus to Dickerson road, checked into a motel and got his groove on 🤣
100
https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2017/01/18/how-smart-are-you-the-stolen-money-viral-math-problem-the-correct-answer-explained/
What if the owner stole it from the customer and the customer was just getting his money back from him
The real question is, what do you think the bum bought
Dude now you’re thinking!
And we don't really know when this happened. Inflation could have been pretty drastic between now and then
null
null
🤦‍♂️
The correct answer is nobody knows...the $70 worth of merchandise was profit for the owner. For all we know the owner could have inherited the merchandise for nothing and turned around and sold that shit for 70 and profited $70 🤷🏽‍♂️
He actually dropped it without realizing it and then the bum picked it up 
If the guy stole the 100 and walked outside and gave it to a bum and then the bum made the 70 dollors purchase. How much did he lose Andy? 
I'm excited to see my Justin Bieber haired captain 
😔😔
Nah
Owner lost $30 cash (real money) and an undisclosed ORIGINAL AMOUNT in merchandise 
It's almost fucking here 
Are y'all excited for the mother fucking draft
Bahahaha 
The bigger issue here is Andy runs a business. Think about that. 🤔
Dollors 
100 follows was stolen. He lost 100

I'll cash it for $100
Take that to the bank and cash it 😉
Negative 
Answer is A $30 
Woooooooo i answered right for the first time in my life..take that fucking high school teachers 
If owner purchased stuff for $70 and turns around and sells it for $70 he ain’t making no money 😂😂😂
$100
bitch
but it’s not zero so a can never be correct
😑😑😑
The $70 “worth of goods” is retail price. The owner purchased that stuff cheaper and is selling at $70 retail price...so If that’s the case nobody really knows how much money the owner technically lost 🙀
$100
not discounted to zero... as long as they’re still in the store they’re potentially worth $70
@Dylan Pine But the $70 worth of goods was really purchased at a discounted price...how else could the owner make a profit? So the real answer is A) $30 😉
Good point 🧐
but i’m hammered so who knows
but now he can’t sell that $70 worth of shit to the next guy... sounds like a hundo to me
Question states How much MONEY did the owner lose 
I would say A then 
Only one 
Can't be two answers 
I came up with $30 cash and $70 worth of merchandise so I would say A or C 
Cool cool no answer 
@Andy Rangel $100
C

I vote yes for the ppr, but only if it’s 0.17 points per reception 
I still love you...
It's more like this

@Christopher Lynn Rangel over there like...
only need 2 more
We are up to 5

null
I also vote Yes to weed 
Me too!
Oh oh oh 
Yes to weed
Yes to 6.8 ppr
Yes to .5 pt ppr.
As far as I know no one has voted against 
I vote yes
Okay... how about this... either vote on that poll or type out your vote on this chain by the end of the day, or your vote is forfeited... that way we can have an answer for those who want to preplan their picks...
null
Aahhhhhhh... I’m picking up whacha layin down...
While you do get a gain regardless of half or whole point, it seems half point still respects TD value more than whole point. 
null
I love you 
null
Motherfucker looked up the definition
😂😂😂
null
null
I like it when you use big words 
Either they get a point for a reception or they don't. The value is arbitrary I think 
It scales 
I don't see a difference between half point and full point 
Relying on Cody to explain stuff sounds scary...
Cody had to explain to me cause I misunderstood it
What’s the reason behind doing .5 pt instead of either keeping the way it is, or doing 1 pt?
Click on the black lady, then polls
Can you put the link back up here?
Vote you mofos
null
Damnit Alfred 😔
!vote
Can you see who all has voted @Christopher Lynn Rangel ?
I think .5 PPR is a good move. I totally agree @Paul Miller I want to think about moving to keeper next year too. We just have to keep everyone in the league.
#DYNASTY
Also, I’d vote for everyone drafting this year with keeper in mind for future...
So is the .5 ppr thing happening, or just smoke?
null
null
null
321 is a good method
Smoke for at least 2 hours, then wrap
3, 2, 1?
No wrap right now

Go to the meeting and poop yourself. Get to leave early.
This should be enough
I have a meeting in 10 minutes but I also have diahhrea 
Kickers flying off the board. Be able to get Gurley and Bell in the 3rd.
#justiceforfuller
I'll take that 
That's fair 
Yes but no points for the TD @Christopher Lynn Rangel 
Will fuller for exampleb
First round, everyone takes a kicker
Can punt returns get points for every yard 
So the strategy is you want a really bad one. 
This league has exceeded my expectations 
40 yarder = 24 points
How about we make kickers negative points for each field goal they make 
I think we should give kickers .5 points for every yard of the kick plus their points. 
Dats my boi
Nooooooooo
I vote we keep kicker! 
😂
whoopsie

Come. On yeti
Gosh dammit I love it
I vote no more kickers. Wes is very persuasive 
I'll buy you a 3 month sub to premiumasian.com
I'm sensing collusion @Nick Wayne 
Mmmmmm. 
Well, the voice of reason is clearly biased and no longer reasonable.
I’m voting opposite of whatever Christopher says. 
One QB, two RBs two WRS, two Flex spots and defense 
@Nick Wayne  can we get a voice of reason on Kickers?
Yea kuck kickers 
KUCK FICKERS
I want to go down in history as the greatest league of low expectations 
FUCK KICKERS
The Fantasy Footballers did it too
My bad. I forgot we switched to fan duel 
Let's be apart of the next great move 
Fan duel did 
So we are going half. Point ppr but won't talk about kickers
We can get rid of the kickers when the NFL does
He knows me so well
Remove kicker 
Let's talk about it

And you aren't remembering correctly Chris. It was that day - I got that shit changes in minutes.

Remember when @Christopher Lynn Rangel could type a sentence without random periods in the middle of them?
Nah I got fucked as well
It was just me and Chris who suffered over the vetoes.

Remember when I got points for. The return on the titans and then yanked away the next day 
😁😁😁
Y'all remember the first few weeks of our first season when no trades made it through because of vetos 
Probably looking up ways to. Cause collusion 
@Nick Wayne where the hell you at?
You Asian women loving bastard

Correct
Was it nick Wayne 
Who said that the first year cody
No one can prove that...
Cody and Chris are colluding... Bitch voicd

Collusion!!!! 
Collusion 
Cost me a championship 
No vote from me
No punt return points
I was 11th.
@Brian O'Cain 😂
Last place always wants change the next year
Fucking loser
Bitch ass is just mad that it didn't happen to his player 
Fuck Cody 
I don't make it to the playoffs so I don't think Andy has a good point 
I'll hook you up baby
Cody isn't a commissioner
There will be no punt return points...
Dem garbage time points thoooooo
I'm. Okay with that 
If you agree to eliminate defense and kickers I'll make the change 
If we are changing everything then I want change for punt returns 
Maybe 
Will will fuller get punt return points 
Because I want to lose in the first round of the playoffs because my opponent got a -1yard reception in garbage time

Half point PPR is a good move for the league. 
But give me 20 minutes until the kids go to bed 
I'm completely sober
Put the weed down Wesley
🤣
Or we could get rid of kickers and defense for the betterment of the league 🤔
Also nerfing kickers is a good change 
Half point PPR is moving the league in the right direction for the future. It’s a good change. We’ve been very good at making changes to better the league. This is one of those changes.
I’m happily undecided 
👌
just wait until y'all see the draft board this year 
HALF POINT PPR GET HYPE 
Make it. Better for the wr and rbs
Wooooo
Half point PPR WOOOOOO!
I'm all in for the half ppr

@Wes Young's soft ass hands can do some amazing things.
Pretty cool stuff. And he did this in like 3 hours.
So this is basically a funny test he said. This is part one - making the bot talk to Group Me and respond. Part two is using the ESPN api to make it pull data for updates for us. 
He is brilliant. I want to integrate this into all my chats

@Brian O'Cain @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Cody Alexander @Dylan Pine @Justin Rossano @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Brown @Nick Wayne @Paul Miller @Wes Young circa 2017! 
I'll dig into the espn api later this week.
I'm a decent programmer but I'm not that good.
Have no idea why it did the link
You should make it write game narratives like NFL.com does after games. 
but that will be later.
I've worked out how to make the bot tag names, just have to build it.
I figured, �
No one is. Like no one.
If anyone is remotely interested in looking at the code, it's here: https://github.com/WesYoung91/FF_Bot/tree/master/src/main/java/com/ffbot/container
�
No, FUCK YOU Wes Young!
fuck you bot
I'm done working on the bot today since I basically didn't do any of my real work. But the bot will eventually be hooked up to ESPN's api so it can throw some usefull/useless information into the chat once the season starts.

Failing to pay fees and dues before the draft will result in your first pick being used to draft Tim Tebow.
or just do it for him
@Justin Rossano  please contact@Paul Miller  and force him to do this.
@Brian O'Cain are you sure?
Nope. I am not downloading that sketchy app 
also, benefit of using Cash App is that the moment the season closes, we can pay winnings through the app so we don't have to physically hand over money.
@Dylan Pine  I told you that you could pick it up whenever you wanted. No one ever did.
He said it 
😱😱😱
so like december prob
ill pay just as promptly as i got paid my winnings... 🙄🙄🙄

Time to collect transaction fees and test the app we are putting in place for digitally collecting league dues this year. Everyone needs to download an app called Cash and use this to pay their transaction fees. The money will be transferred to me and I will hold it for the season. Below is a list of transactions owed:                                           Cody - $11

Wes gonna get drunk before he drafts
Yessssssssssssss
And I'd prefer to start my drinking around 3:45
Let's draft @ Above All...
I'm just there to drink and draft 
My vote is for Dave and Busters. Better environment and more to do
Tired of being in nashville lol
Our hero has spoken...
😂
He said go. With Dave and. Busters 
Let me call Marcus mariota real quick hold on 
We can vote on it. Before the poll gets put up does anyone else have any suggestions? @Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Dylan Pine @Justin Rossano @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Wayne @Paul Miller @Nick Brown @Wes Young @Todd Wiencek @Christopher Lynn Rangel ?
#daveandbusterskilledMcNair
#ghettolifeisforme
Woooooo we going to get shot at woooooooo
The limit is only on the room. We won’t need more than 4 hours to draft. If we do Dave and busters, we can finish drafting and go bowling or to the arcade
I don't want to have a time limit 
@Nick Brown August 24th 
It's 🔥
Stouts is my vote.
What’s the date
And @Andy Rangel is looking into a place called Dolan's in Franklin that his friend manages

We can get a private room at a place called Stout's in Brentwood and draft there .
Anyone have any draft location suggestions? Justin got the info for Dave and Buster's and it'll be about $36.50 per person including everyone pitching in for the board bitch, paying for an extra hour in the private room for a total of 4 hours, 3 food platters, and 2 alcoholic drinks per person.

Problem with the Sounds game is that is gonna be cold and windy
But you said inside outside eating
Weather seems to have calmed down 
I’m kinda up to take a chance...
If you want outdoor games we might as well stop arguing and go to sounds game like originally planned 
That’s why I’m the commish
Damn good recap 
True

And this @Nick Brown 
He’s lucky AF he didn’t catch one 😂
null
@Nick Brown 1. There is a debate between the Double Dogs on 21st and the one on Charlotte. 
2. Some of the Samsung guys can’t see GIFs

4. Andy wants everyone to get hype and drink early and go to Rebar

Guy could probably win a playoff game....

Justin don't be bitter because you're not a cool dad like the captain
Cool. Y’all can talk about Fortnite there too

Start our own league
I just talked to Paul. He’s good with it
We're basically the same person so I speak for both 
Can I come. Too
If guy joins @Paul Miller  and myself are leaving 
Wes, you need to Be mad at Andy. Nobody else
And yet still - Guy will be meeting us at Double Dogs tomorrow.

Don’t start this bullshit

Yay!
Cody, Asian Nick, Champion Nick, Wes, Chris, myself, O’Cain, Todd, Dylan
🤷🏽‍♂️
So who all is in?
There is a double dogs on Charlotte as well 
That’s fine. We were planning on driving to Nashville for the game, so we can stick with that plan
I'm out on anything south of Nashville pretty much. I work at home tomorrow so I don't plan to drive that far down. If I was working here I'd just stay
They are pretty awesome
There’s Double Dogs in Hillsboro Village
null
I’m gonna pass on Sportsman’s 
I’m down with a good sports bar in Nashville too
they're closing soon so it would be good for old times sake
Sportsmans on 21st
There’s always Twin Peaks
it's about 100x better than that other shitty buffalo place
it’s also not that good
slight exaggeration but there is a lot of TVs
I really don't want to drive all the way out to cool springs tomorrow at 5:30 but there is a pretty awesome bar/restaurant called buffalo wings & rings and it has 100s of TVs
Apparently so
Did Shannon tell him no?
Oh, and Andy just informed me that he will not be joining us
We need a backup plan for tomorrow since there’s a chance of rain

Wow

Android messaging /allo

😂😂
He's already ordered one...
The fact that there is a little me is fucking terrifying...
you know it... my ass is a little worried you better believe it
@Dylan Pine about to pay so hard for all those years he's been raising hell...
But splitting a season package is a pretty good deal still. Preds have 40 home games. The games you don’t go to, you can sell. Plus you have first access to playoff tickets 
I used to go to 8-10 games a year
And single game seats will probably be that much next year, because they are sold out on season tickets next year
Crazy. Never would've guessed.
Usually it’s around that
They are pretty expensive man. 
On a serious note @Justin Rossano - are the Antioch tickets really 80 fucking dollars?
That’s a fantastic analogy 
Hahahaha
In the Antioch section
The lower bowl is like Davidson/Williamson county. You want tickets in the Lawrence, Giles, Hickman county sections.
Not the assholes that pay to sit down low and sit the entire game, don’t chant, and all that bullshit
I’ve wanted them for a couple seasons, somewhere up high where the “real fans” sit
Yeah, unfortunately it’s the “cool thing in town” now and they are outrageously expensive 
I sit next to two people at work thst have season tickets 
I want to get season tickets, but need 1 to 2 other people to split them with
I remember when you could get them sumbitch for nothing. Back when no one gave a fuck.
I only went to one game this season because of that
I'm not that committed yet 
I'm out 
Nah
$80
What are cheap regular season Preds tickets now Justin?
null
I wanna order an Arvi one
I think they're a bit warmer because the sleeves are long 
The new adidas ones are nice. I found a site that has them cheaper than in the pro shop
I really want a jersey. They are just generally cooler than football jerseys I think.
On the real - off-season league activity next year!
I did. I’ve been to at least 20 games. But now that they are good, ticket prices are outrageous 
You gave me your blessing @Justin Rossano 
😳 I've only been to one. 
Yeah, I would say bandwagon, but you were super late to the party
And also that I've been to more than three games 
Me and Wes anguished over whether or not it was a bandwagon move. Determined it wasn't by virtue of hometown team.
I'm a hardcore t-shirt fan 
I also did not own on until last year 
Considering your ass didn’t own a Preds shirt until last year’s playoff run, I figured it was worth explaining 
Yes I get it. Thank you Dr. Hockey...
Best sport live
It's really exciting
I don't know why I never watch hockey in regular season. 
Power up/Back to full strength 
Yeah, that’s an Avalanche thing 
Yeah that's cool
Pretty cool...
Did anyone else just hear the Mario power up sound when the powerplay ended? 😂😂😂
No doubt.
That pic is going to be memed this entire upcoming season
I love that picture...

Off the 24th, on days the 25th and 26th

The S9 is about $1000 so I wouldn't get to carried away on the price difference.

Fucking knew it @Brian O'Cain 
😭😭😭
Night
He won’t let me down like you did last jyear that
He won't let you down, he has been suggested in the past but he is on C shift. We were trying to keep it on just 2 shifts, but since Justin has moved..... 
He sends his condolences 
@Paul Miller 
Talked to him yesterday 
@Paul Miller 
New job. 
I need more Paul in my life 
Paul is in
@Paul Miller 
I feel like his participation is lacking 
What about @Paul Miller 
Be ye not wary of the temptations that are before hand
He can put up with all the bullshit this league offers, and give it right back. He has already agreed to comply with our demands for participation in the league chat
So he has a gambling problem 
My fellow league members..are we going to allow this to take place..to take in another brother..just to get broken hearted again
He was running up to 12 teams a week on draft kings for the past 2 years
Big Todd all up in this bitch
Is he trying to say he is the GOAT
I'mma need details Justin
Yeah baby!
null
🤔🤔🤔
He will be at the game next Thursday 
null
On a positive note, I went out and secured us a replacement last night that is solid 
@Brian O'Cain  For allowing us to play on the same game as him
null

I love you guys

If y’all really need a backup for mason I have a legit contender 
because this is how you get polio
Do you want fucking polio?
@Justin Rossano  he's one of the few people that I have actually removed from my facebook
😂😂
Other than not vaccinating his kids, Guy is a viable option
I’m open to all new people. 
I’m dead 
I'm also physically sick after typing that
Andy has a better option
null
Just keeping options open 
Now Wesley, this is for the good of the league. It’s not for certain, but he seems like a good dude.
@Justin Rossano  if this "backup" is named Guy Powell, You're going to need a second backup as well.
He will give you a raise...
Just talked to Cody. We have a backup in case Mason is out this year
😂😂😱
When my boss asks why I haven't finished my project yet, I'll show him this.

I will confirm with @Brian O'Cain That was definitely the guy sitting behind us and to our right at the game
null
Are you serious Brian? You remember that guy?
So who's going to mortgage their house to pay for this guy's tab to be our board bitch?
🤣🤣🤣
That is the same guy who yelled the whole game with his shirt off. I really think that is him..... 
This is an idea worth pursuing...
He struck me somewhere between bud heavy and Natty ice...
maybe we can just bring a keg to his house and have the draft party there. he looks like a bud heavy kinda guy
We can't have him be the board bitch... His tab would put us all in debt...
we should have him at our draft party
I want to party with him 
That guy can probably out drink all of us combined at a tailgate...

king kunta 👌🏻👌🏻
JEEZY!
Or just listen to the Jeezy discography and be happy 
Then nearly every bit of damn is great 
For your Kendrick listening experience, start with good kid maad city, skip most of to pimp a butterfly except a couple of songs. 
😂
Wes went momentarily British...
It's very much a studio genre 
Live*
Rap never sounds good love. 
I wouldn’t have taken a free ticket to that performance 
m.A.A.d city 🔥🔥🔥
I like some of his stuff he’s very deep with his lyrics 
So true. 
Dude Kendrick is fire tho! 
I don’t get the hype about him
Mostly everything. Just not Kendrick Lamar
@Justin Rossano Out of curiosity what kind of music do you listen to? 
null
Like the jags and bills game 
Regardless, this is fucking boring

I would go ahead and tell Nicole beforehand if she were there. 
consequences...
@Wes Young would have all the same consequesnces is it were Mariota...
Jesus
Absolutely...
Deckers wife count?
@Nathaniel Collier would get a restraining order, possibly charged with some sort of sex crime, and have to see a doctor for an erection lasting longer than four hours...
null
😂😂😂
First? Those are rookie numbers 
That would be the moment when Wes gets his first restraining order...
@Paul Miller Did run into him Friday afternoon at Teds in Nashville 
Sports figures primarily - former Titans or NFL players, maybe a Preds player, actor or actress, sportscaster etc...we would define fame on a case by case basis...
I’m gonna get Mariota to come draft for make Wes sit at the other end of the room
And everyone has to buy his drinks for the night
Not Paul on Wheel of Fortune famous...
Define “famous”
We need to start a contest to see if we can get a famous person to come be our board bitch...whoever gets someone to come gets to choose where they draft...
With a JUICE license plate
next
We need to write him a letter and see if he will come to our draft nect year...
That's what I figured...
#billsmafialeader
He isn’t allowed to drive anything else
In my heart I hope he drives a white bronco...
Powerbombs someone through table - catches another murder charge...
Hell yeah he does...
If the Juice powerbombs somebody through a table, I’m gonna be all in as a Bills fan

Bills Mafia vs Raiders fans...aw yeah...
I wish the Bills Mafia could field a football team instead of the real Buffalo Bills. #SuperBowl 
Very possible 
I think there are more bills fans there than jags 
They truly are the pride and joy of the NFL fan base 
These guys are on a whole different kind of level 
https://instagram.com/p/Bdp6-k7jIu3/
For those of you who have forgotten - we are 2 wins away from being in the Super Bowl #TITANUP
Yeah...damn I'm torn...I don't want Jacksonville to win shit and Bills going forward would be awesome but I would much rather play the Patriots than the Steelers...
I need the Bills Mafia to advance
My playoff hopes - Jacksonville beats Bills, Titans beat Patriots, Jacksonville beats Steelers, and then Titans beat the FUCK out of Jacksonville...mmmmmmmmmm...
null
If you were 0-4 in Superbowls you would have a hatred for random shit too...
I don’t know, but there is an extreme hatred towards them, and I’m so glad it exists
What do the bills have against tables 
That would be amazing 
I honestly thought that was @Nick Brown celebrating his championship before I read the comments. 
I hope they win and invade Shittsburgh

I would love to go to a bills tailgate

@Wes Young I don’t get the meme...

Mariota won that game for us...Henry played incredibly and the D was shutdown in the second half...
HOLY SHIT MARIOTA THE GOAT 
@Andy Rangel is late as fuck on the fantasy answer...yes it counts as 12 points...
Concerning fantasy 
Mariota pulled that shit off 😂
If a QB throws a pass to himself and scored a TD does he get credited a pass TD and receiving TD???
But it would be nice if the jags lost 
I think we'd have an easier time with the pats 
If they lose its pats 
If they win its Pitt 
Unless the bills win
Or Pittsburgh 
Titans playing patriots next week? 
TENNESSEE!!!

Nate do you really have 10 kids? @Cody Alexander 👀
Vegas>Nashville 
Because we beat the jags 
Why didnt we get Gruden?
Mularkey is still a bitch BUT GO TITANS 
Get that gruden contract 
Titans going to the Super Bowl

But hey we made it to the playoffs and that's cool...
SF wins.
Jimmy G facing down his mentor.
Next year, Patriots and SF in the super bowl
SF will definitely be a contender next year 
Fun fact, Jimmy G has never lost a NFL game
How bitches be when Jimmy G walks into the room 
https://m.popkey.co/e0597a/oAv9w_s-200x150.gif
I feel like they fuck his tempo so much it's like hitting reset every few plays...
I'd suck Jimmy G's dick
done very well with it but never got to use it.
looks so good in it
Bad play calling is fucking us...need to run that spread no huddle more...MM looks like a fucking boss in the no huddle...
JG handsome AF @Wes Young 
Agree with @Andy Rangel  that is...
SF winning superbowl next year.
Agree...I've heard the foot is also still bothering him...
We should trade all of our draft picks to SF to get that suave motherfucker Jimmy G
Bad plays calls force MM to fuck up 
I blame the coach for MM being so shitty this year 
Brady would've thrown 43 TDs to Decker this year...
This year?
Is MM franchise material? Last year, yes.
Decker is white 
Decker's hands aren't like they used to be...
MM threw some catchable balls Sunday to Decker and that mofo dropped a lot
Truth is they can all catch but they’re not super heroes gosh damnit! 
Wrong, almost right 🤔, and BYARD BABY!!!
THE BEST RECEIVER IS THE ONE WHO MARIOTA THROWS A CATCHABLE BALL TO 
The opposing teams secondary?
Delanie
Whos the best receiver for the Titans?
Need to feed Henry and keep Demarco on that bench...
😂
MM been feeding the ball hard to the opposing team
They need to feed the ball MORE to COREY DAVIS 
pass rush solid.
run defense be weak
and maybe a solid LB
They need to draft a better O line 
Thoughts on drafting a QB?
shit.
but fire Robiskie
i don't care
keep mularkey.

Just need to go ahead and get this loss out of the way so we can get some Josh McDaniels\
Titans should win this week, but I think the road stops there

I don't have any winnings tied up in it so it seems perfectly fine to me.
that seems unwise...
ATTENTION!!!!@Cody Alexander  is picking up the money from me this coming Sunday. That money includes everyone's except@Andy Rangel  and the literal thousands that Cody owes. If it goes missing or is spent on utility bills, you know who to look at.
I've got $50 in FAAB left. Just take mine out of that.

wireless is for n00bs. you can’t get the highest quality lossless audio over bluetooth 
 Probably won’t have any left after the falcon
@Nick Brown you should buy some decent headphones with your winnings. 
you probably all use the basic apple earbuds. 
what is wrong with you savages. 
No

It has been a pleasure being a part of the League Of Low Expectations. It’s a shame that no other team was able to compete with the STD’s and I had to wreak as much carnage as I did. It has truly been an honor to beat each and every team.
I would like to thank a few people. First of all I have to thank my mother. Without her none of this would not even be possible. Second of all I would like to thank Cody. I had a feeling that all of his wins previously have been purely luck, so as he would give me advice I would just do the exact opposite and it has really propelled my team to the top and his straight to the bottom!! Anyways here is a short video clip that I want to leave you all with.
Well, it’s part of that whole “Cody is a bitch” thing and just another reason to vote him out of the league 
i didn’t know waiting til the season was over was an option
null
Lmao! The co-commish is holding the money, and currently waiting on @Cody Alexander to pay up 
@Justin Rossano hey commish if you want to drop off my winnings today at st 2 i’ll be in your bed

yes yes
Justin’s team will play good this coming week just like they did this past week
😒
Tate 
And golden gate
mmmmmm
Dropping Alex Collins 
If I still had him, I would have him on the bench..... 
I hate AB

Such a beast

Cody, your team is tainted. 
I'm only dropping Kelce...I feel like Ebron is better...
*1 million FAAB playoff bonus only applies to league commissioners. Some restrictions may apply
I’m in
I'm in
oh man
Last 4 teams in the playoffs get 1 million FAAB dollars to use for the remainder of the season
Wes gonna go in and hit everyone up with a service tax. 😂 
Imma about to log in and edit mine up to 1000
I'm faab poor
Currently thinking about all of the ways to spend my money
null
Yes. Heavy collusion with $1
Says person who only has a dollar in FAAB...#COLLUSION
oooooooOOOOOooOOooOooOOoOoooOOoo
I hope that teams vacating their roster have a new league to go to next year 😂
that way your only player will be broken. Just like your playoff run.
Andy just keep wentz 
@Nick Brown that's how I read it
So u “could” drop everybody except 1 and still be OK 👌 
I'm not dropping everyone - I'm keeping David Johnson...
BUT, if someone would like to drop me a couple gems, that would be allowed
Just to be clear, you are NOT to drop your entire roster if you have lost. This is something that we can entertain for next year, but it would skew the remaining playoffs. 
null
😂😂😂

I’m seriously bout to drop my whole team tomorrow morning 😏
Lemme get Drake 
It shined like a mother fucker!!! You put up killer numbers 😳
A sun shines on a dogs ass every now and again. 
Everyone decided to play on my team this week!

Thanks for WHOOOPIN THE HELL out of me this week Nick I can’t even be mad such a dominating win HOLY SHIT!!! 😭😭😭

Hey Wes. I accidentally forgot that Stewart was gonna have 28 points. Can you swap him out for Demarco?
Y’all keep changing shit!  😂 
like absorbing the energy from your defeated foes
no, but that is a really cool idea for a league. 
So in the playoffs whoever wins gets to pick 1 player from the other team? Right?
@Brian O'Cain Can I please get Landry back.
Can't believe fucking Andy got him for free
Drake is a monster

But this year is looking alright. 
Thanks man
I wasn’t gonna bring it up @Wes Young 
And promptly lost two in a roe
null
I made playoffs last year. 
Paul has been mediocre for the last 2 years 😂
It’s the first year struggle. I missed the playoffs last year and now...regular season champ
I almost sat A. Smith. He showed out with 45 points and then the rest of the team thought they were on a bye week 
I appreciate your continued contribution to the league. 
Sorry cap
I lost another one. I am really getting good at this losing thing....

Ughhhh andy got beat ughhhhh take that Mexican
I love cbs *bitch voice*
1. Chris
2. Nate
3. Paul
4. Cody
5. O’Cain 
6. Mason
I bet cbs has a way to do this.
Way to go@Chris Rangel  for picking ESPN.
Yeah, I’m not seeing a way to manually adjust it. In that case, we rank them 1-6. 1 plays 6, 2 plays 5, and 3 plays 4
Or a “super” sticker?
Ugh, fucking ESPN 
Does the winner get a participation ribbon? 
I don't see a way to give them a bye week. 
The consolation bracket should be set as the following:
Chris and Paul get bye weeks due to the records in their respective divisions. Nate plays O’Cain and Cody plays Mason. The winner of Nate/O’Cain plays Chris, and the winner of Cody/Mason plays Paul
Got knocked the fuck out 😂
not that it matters though.
Trying to figure out how to set the consolation bracket...
Playoff bracket is set.

We need to place bets on playoff teams...
Well if the pattern continues he won't be there for long...
No..no it doesn’t..idk how Wes has been in the playoffs back to back
True...doesn't make it feel any better...
We called it before the season began

And collusion. 
Wes accidentally fell into that bye week. No real strategy just luck and some more luck. 
Wes said it was NEVER meant for you Asian nick 👀
Damn shots fired 
It was technically never his bye week. 
Deeper hatred that Wes took your bye week or Chris C calling the game 👀

Bryanna yelled "you're so ghetto" to the woman from GE customer service - this occured yesterday...
Can we throw Andy overboard?

Their powers combined 
Let's do the cruise this year...let's go...
Bryanna too
I’ve heard June gets shit done

She would survive 
Nah, Crystal could sit in the casino
For sure divorce 
Bring the bitches 
Let's fucking draft next week. Too hype 
Oh, that could be worse 
The idea is to bring spouses with us
@Nick Brown With that captains money and no kids....he is buying all the alcohol 
@Nick Brown i think the idea is to take spouses

The last time I went on a “guys” cruise someone almost got divorced.

CODY ON THE BUCK 
We can find some chick on the boat to be our board bitch
General Jackson? @Andy Rangel 
Andy wants to take a cruise on a pontoon down the Cumberland 
$300/person
And the Andrew Jackson 👀
3 or 4 day is pretty damn cheap
For a three day 
Which is another reason why I said to get another year under our belts before switching 
250ish a person I think
Agreed. Next year would be out for me too
What are the prices??? 
Probably out on destination draft next year but the following I'm all in. 
I have looked at both options pretty heavily. A cruise would be much cheaper 
�
Pick either one. 
Seriously though we need to start thinking about next years draft...I’m down for a cruise tho or VEGAS 👀
This is true
Wes would rather give you his child
It would be fair
No
Wes needs to give me that bye
Just let it happen buddy

I hate to bring up old business but Wes admitted that having two commissioners with bye weeks was shady.

Drafting Greg zurlein first round 
Imma be fuckin hammered 
I feel like I need to physically go to Games and scout players 😂😂😂
30 rounds
Long term commitment. 
Kinda like David Johnson 
Thinking about the first draft for the dynasty makes my dick hard. 
I think it will be less overall work in a sense...
I drafted a very marginal team. 
i feel like i would need a fucking secretary to be in a dynasty league lol
We’re going to re-draft next year THEN START DYNASTY 
A dynasty works very much like an NFL team does @Nick Wayne 
We would draft a dynasty team...
I think that we need one more year under our belt as a league before switching 
We'd start fresh nick
Can we make trades before we lock in the dynasty?
But I'm completely in 
I really love the idea of a dynasty but it's more of a commitment and a long term type of thing. 
Out some salsa on it
I mean Paul
I'm confused like Taco. 
Lol
Yes it is
After this year yes
Next year yes 😏
I like the idea of doing one. 
Unless everyone wants it to be. 
Hell to the mother fucking no
No
So this is a dynasty league now?
👋🏽
I can't wait to lose my first game of the playoffs like last year.
Sweeeeeet
I'll let you touch it.
I want to take pics with it too
sure
Can I borrow the trophy when you win
m o i s t
moist
I don't want to but that's because my team makes me moist.
Of course we'd redraft buddy
that way I have AB, Evans, Baldwin, McCoy & Gordon

Hush little bitch 
Quiet peasant 
I need M Bryant to have a Julio Jones performance tonight 🙏🏽
And be disqualified from playoff contention 
But the person trading dj will forfeit one win. 
Correct. A David Johnson trade may take place anytime during the season
That’s correct
Trading DJ isn't subject to the deadline correct @Justin Rossano and @Wes Young ?
Sounds fair...
Both trades useless
I’d say that’s pretty fair
Yea I’ll give you dak and dez
You interested Christopher?
That's correct...
David Johnson still available?
I tried and you were like "ugh but..." and other period noises...
Fucking Hunt
Doing it now. 
Yes, you really should 
@Wes Young I should.  
@Nick Wayne you could always drop them to waivers.

Damnit...Amari points on the bench 😓
"Doug Baldwin is a second half player"
points were scored

Did all the work and they give it to Demarco 
Poor Henry. 
Time for Demarco to step down. 
HENRY BABY!
They said before the was on a snap count 
Did he get hurt again or just precaution?
I guess Greg Olsen only played one drive 
Henry has a dirty stiff arm 
I do think we are getting a trophy for that Chris. 
I’m about that bench point life
Mmmmmm my bench points every week fuck yea

They are exclusive in this scenario. But if you were to pull off both....
Are you they mutually exclusive? 
What option for A and B
Wes, I am very curious about what would be more satisfying:

A. You eliminating Cody from the playoffs this week

B. You win the league championship

C. Winning the lottery. (This is not likely, but is good for comparison to options A and B)

1186.1	 to 918.5
you have to win at least one
I NEED THAT BYE WEEK
correct
I just can’t lose the next two
you have him beat by a ridiculous amount of total points. 
not really, you could lose to him since you already beat him once and still win the tie breaker. 
This week’s game between Andy and I has all the marbles on it. Heavy bye week implications 
BTW. It's Asian Monday!!!!!
https://media1.giphy.com/media/7o8VVj6IIpKs8/giphy.gif
Or maybe get Justin to lose a few games?
Can we share it Wes?  
@Nick Wayne needs to stop going after my bye week. 
Rules are rules 🤷🏽‍♂️
that's my co-commissioner. 
😭😭😭
The way ESPN scored it is correct. Points are correct. Andy, quit whining 😂
yep
Based on yahoo answers 😂😂😂
I might be fucked on those 2 points 😩 I’ve been reading about it...says if it’s behind line of scrimmage (pass) and player gets TD it would be a rushing TD. Because if they didn’t catch lateral it would be considered a fumble 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️😱
Call ESPN if you have any issues they’re very helpful
🤤
The lady I talked to at ESPN said she understands my frustration
😂😂😂
null
Fuck you!!!
They said it would be a stat correction
Fuck you little bitch I just called ESPN and it’s going to be taken care of
so fuck off and I hope you lose by exactly 1.9. 
@Andy Rangel I even went and checked NFL leagues and he wasn't credited. 
This was additional payment by @Justin Rossano to @Paul Miller for Carlos Hyde!!
I know you do 
at this point, I hope you do. 
WE aren't going to have any problems. 
If I lose because of the 2 points we’re gonna have some problems 
@Justin Rossano will you kindly tell @Andy Rangel to stop whining?
I’m still waiting to hear from commissioner Justin
They made a mistake. What’s their number? 
I literally cannot control what espn enters stats in as. 
if it was, espn would have given you the points. 
Is that not considered a pass?
got em
lmao laterral. 
Is this a rushing 2 point conversion to you?

Going back to CBS...

Maybe it was a toss that you thought was a pass. 
Call espn

Espn has it listed as a rush

Yup
Also, fuck you Andy. I tried to get the chargers this week
I need Brady to throw it to the OTHER black guy #14 🤞🏽

Damn Paul, your defense was 1 yard away from a td
Hnnnnggggg. Mccoy makes my dick hard

Howard and my whole team for sale 😩
@Justin Rossano Just wanted to point out a trend here. 
Added a graph for a visual aid of your odds of winning the survival pool.

Who’s left in the survival pool? 
I keep losing track.
Fuck yeah 🤤
That Waffle House tho!

Lol
What my team is doing to poor Mason already 
null
Honestly, 16 points is more than I thought he'd end with. 
And Mariota had a decent game. Minus 4 interceptions 
Crazy
AB bailed me out. 
null
Exactly my thinking 
Antonio Brown should be thanking me for trading him. If I would have kept him, he would have not done anything and they probably would have lost. 
null
null
Y'all need to stop doubting Mariota 
@Chris Rangel We are going Monday!
Should've started Rishard...holy shit...fuck my defense I just want to win this game...WOOOOOOO...

I didn't make the start decision until 5 min before 
I dropped Mariota to the waiver knowing Wes’ fanboy love would pick him up and start him. Secretly initiated the downfall 😱
I regret this decision 
Interception
Dayuuummmmm

It's unlikely.
I don’t see it happening with his remaining schedule 
I will probably be physically sick if he makes it in. 
Yes, it’s really all that matters at the moment 
@Dylan Pine Just worry about not losing your playoff spot to @Cody Alexander 
like why are all these players from different teams on the same plane with the entire Saints defense?
we've been over this before, it's logistically challenging for all of them to be on the same plane. 
i hope your whole team dies in a plane crash
Shots fired
It's a playoff thing. You wouldn't understand. 
you paid 10 bucks for mariota!? 😂
So did @Andy Rangel

Highest week @Justin Rossano 
Survivor pool @Brian O'Cain is out.
Transaction fees are up to $127.50. 
@Nick Brown and @Wes Young had a tight game as did @Dylan Pine and @Nick Wayne . @Nathaniel Collier took a loss while his bench quietly scored more than @Brian O'Cain's team. 
Also, David Johnson's cast came off and he is still available. 😉
Words hurt Wesley. 
Honestly went to be expecting to lose. 
It was just a little bit.

Why are you worrying nick. You've got this. 
Hit was loud. 
Looks like it hurt

Problem is I need to be hauling ass!

The league message board is on ESPN.
3. Requests may be submitted up until 5 minutes before game time. It is the responsibility of the commissioner and co-commissioner to ensure the players are on the correct team before game time. We will do our best to process these requests early. It is the team manager’s responsibility to add that player to their starting lineup once the add/drop has been processed.
After talking with Wes this morning, we are making it possible to add/drop anyone on Sunday, not just for emergencies. Free agency will be open, without having to spend your FAAB budget. This is the way the ESPN setting was originally intended to be. The way that it works is:

1. Following the FAAB processing at 10pm CST on Saturday night, players remaining will be available on a first come/first serve basis. 

2. You request the player(s) by accessing the league message board (NOT GROUPME). Everyone is able to access it via the app and desktop version. The reason for this is because: any messages in the board show up in the activity feed with the FAAB transactions and it is time stamped. We have the ability to reply to the requests individually. This allows Wes and myself the ability to process the requests as they are received.

If you think so buddy 👍🏽
Losing to Mason really fucked him up
Im glad you got Hyde from Paul and I’m glad you were able to swap out your TE an hour before the game knowing he was questionable all week 👍🏽 
I did
Who said I was bitter?

Yes. I was trying to get Burton, but was not able to find him. When I added Howard, and refreshed, Burton was there. I then added the guy that I intended to in the first place 
You already had Howard
We’re related so there is that
You are just as dumb as Andy. Do you not realize that Ertz was ruled out an hour before the game?
Cheating bastard

I gladly accepted 
If I'm correct, Paul proposed the trade
Paul approached me with that trade

Paul giving up Hyde for devante Parker..really??? 🤷🏽‍♂️

@Wes Young I'm playing Justin this week so this is on you man!
By the way there any other “shady” rules I should know about going forward? 
Meanwhile there is a floor not being grouted and a wall not getting painted @Cody Alexander 
And when you find out your player might not play a week before he plays save your waiver wire money and swap him out an hour before the game. Who cares about Managing your team right? Who cares about waiver deadlines right?

VOICE OF REASON, WHERE ARE YOU
I'm not sure what you expected
League of low expectations 
Yup
even if them being questionable is not new?
😂😂
too brown...
As long as their questionable Dylan it’s considered an emergency 
Just like that
Yes
Swap him for wrong skin color..boom done
Correct
so if i just decide to swap someone sunday morning, i can do it for free before kickoff for any reason?
I’m just here to nag😁
No one had an issue when it was done for paul.
Soooooooooo Shaaaaaaaaaaady 
Nah it seemed right for the commissioner to do it
you could have switched him yourself earlier
https://media1.giphy.com/media/l378uVhvl0T2FvDdC/giphy.gif
game was started
I asked to switch Walker
Okay everyone. Here's where we stand. This was able to be done by the team manager in cbs. We (me) missed a setting that couldn't be changed after entering everyone's players. I have not talked to Justin yet. He didn't have me add the player for him, which is how it should have been done. That being said, had he asked me to drop/add the player, I would have. We've done it for Paul twice this season, and I would do it for anyone else that asked as well.
https://media3.giphy.com/media/dYhSVzw5X7shq/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff5527496c704d4d3ac703

Why even have waiver wire money 🤷🏽‍♂️ since players are questionable and it’s considered an “emergency” I can just easily add a player I want 👍🏽
What the fuck
I don’t see Delanie in my line up
it got real quiet in here
I’ll just keep my players and when I find out they’re not playing that day I’ll just request a free sudden add in 👍🏽
I need to replace Delanie let’s go
Might as well not even have waiver wire...should be free for all 
Exactly 
So if I have a player that is questionable all week and they decide not to play him. That is considered an emergency?
If you let a game start, that's on you 
The games had already started 
Bit different Andy. 
He didn’t even play and nobody gave him the option to change him out...
What about OCAINs player on Thursday...

null
That’s just poor management call man 
And you did it twice this morning @Justin Rossano 🤔
Andy it was in week 1’s edition of the magazine
I don’t recall questionable being an emergency...
The rule only exists for the morning of emergencies 
So when we switched to ESPN and I missed the setting, Paul called me at goddamn 7 am

First come first serve @Andy Rangel 
Gotcha
With CBS you could pick up a free agent in Sunday 
So if my TE suddenly got hurt before today...and I wanted the same TE as Justin then what? 
I’m thinking that rule should only apply during playoffs. Not Reg season. But that’s just me. 
I'd have preferred it be requested instead of done 
You're not wrong @Nick Wayne. 
Good luck 2 everyone except @Dylan Pine 
That's all I'm gonna say about this.

You can't have shady, nick hes already on a team.

Shady. 
Anyone else?

Naw I’m good. I prefer to win fair and square or lose fair and square 
�
Deangelo Williams (I’m pretty sure that’s who he wanted)
It's for of DeShaun Watson breaks his leg at 10 am on Sunday and you have to have a qb 
What d Williams? 
No to pick up players that you'd add through the week. 
Its for game time decisions 
null
I can understand the thing with Paul but this is super shady...
So it’s done for Justin because his #1 TE is ruled out for today??? 
😂
null
It's been done twice all year.. Both times for Paul because he was too lazy to manage throughout the week
Nick Wayne did you know about this sudden add/drop on Sunday??
I’m good @Wes Young 
🙄 wow shady shit going on 
Requests will be made in the order they're received 
Wes did you do it already???
Gonna go give Marcus a pregame pep talk
Wes make this happen! Add Williams and drop CJ
null
I need him 
What have you done Justin... 
I have an open spot
I want Williams 
The intent of it is for replacing game time decisions not picking through the wire while it's free...
Justin/Wes add D Williams and drop CJ Anderson 
@Nick Wayne yes 
😂😂😂
Blame chris
So we just tell you guys who we want from the waiver and you add the for us immediately?
I agree
Should have stayed with CBS

You're supposed to be able to pick up free agents on Sunday

That Dallas run game is stout right now 
I figured the eagles could run on the niners like Dallas did but I forgot the eagles run game sucks
Mistakes were made
🤦‍♂️
😳
You were going to start Smallwood too 😂😂😂
Even if I started agholor over dusty booty stills he still had less than stills
Miami is god awful
Magazine said agholor would go off
Your choice to start Miami dude 🙄
Your choice to bench Hopkins 🙄
Who wants him
Ice cold dusty agholor here
Agholor here
😔
I know..I’m going to stop listening to people
Cody is rubbing off on you
😩
Mistakes have been made on my bench quite a bit
Teams can’t double both Hopkins and Fuller
And they have a bad defense so they have to sling it
Seattle was their toughest matchup defensively, and they made it look easy. 
A touchdown every other catch
Fullers reception to TD ratio is ridiculous 
Texans goin far
Yep they look match-up proof now 
I’m starting Fuller every week. No more bench points 
The damn Texans offense is legit. There is no defense that can hold them down
I play Mason next week 😱😫😫😫
Yeah, he would have beat almost every other team
To bad he was playing u
That he did 
Mason put up a damn good week

3 players, all with replacements. Mariota vs Baltimore and Fuller is playing Indy 🤤
He will probably still win. His fucking team is bullet proof
Justin you have half your team on bye 😱

You really could use a week 12 win against me and my wife’s car needs to be cleaned
Trading him Gordon and Mccoy 
Is that possible @Andy Rangel?
I tried to make a trade deal with Andy if he would detail my car 
No curse you and your players
@Chris Rangel We can work out a deal
It's the nicest I've ever owned 
It looks damn nice

Or you can have more points than all your starters on your bench
Wilson needs 25 more yards for them extra points
Fantasy is a cruel bitch. You can still win 
Pshhh
You won already calm your panties down
Except Baldwin isn't getting any of it 
That game is like the giants game when Eli had a shootout with brees
Watson is fucking crazy
Nah winning is overrated
You'd be winning

I hope a plane lands on their ass

Why? The catch looked Clean

Hunter Henry made a badass catch 
Chargers got the td on that.

At least you have a chance to win

You like that pickup??
Justin your kicked went hard
Might as well have Bortles throwing for the Titans...
null
Dalvin Cook hurt. Doesn’t look good 
Brady would score three TD on his way down. 
Tom Brady would survive 
The logistics are mind boggling
This would be quite peculiar 
With the entire Cincinnati defense 
As in they all were on the same plane, or multiple crashes
Like why are all these random players on the same plane
A very peculiar plane crash
I hope your team dies in a plane crash 
Yeah, but you got hit with this bullet instead
Me dodging that Mariota bullet
Nah, I’m good
You should have taken that trade Justin 
MUH SEASONNNNNNN!!!

Mariota is out with hamstring
Sanu and jones are out?
Are they just giving up or is he hurt?
But he offset with 2 tds

Forward progress had been stopped and then he made a head shot. Should have been ejected. 
I can't believe he wasn't ejected as intentional as it was...
Yeah my dude is out out 😰
I don't know...it was vicious and not like big hit like dirty as fuck low blow...
It was bad. I don’t think it broke, but he may be broken
Helmet to helmet hit

Still early in the season 
I'm cool with that 
O'cains defense scored 32 points in week one. 
My kicker has been on point lately. 
Use money for highest points scored by kicker or defense 
Had to wear the right shirt so the first thing my baby sees is a Titans logo
I think it gets put into the league pool, and used for league things...paying for last place things, league meetings, trophy upgrades etc
It's 🔥
I want your job Wes. Day drinking and playing fantasy football. 
I could use a case of beer right about now
The money needs to be used on something that benefits everyone in the league. I'm not sure exactly what that is though. 
We need to vote on what we're going to do...
Any ideas?
Anyone else?
In my opinion - if we used it for TopGolf or any event it should for flat fee thing... Like TopGolf for instance the bay rentals not for food and drinks ever unless it's for like a tailgate where we are getting a finite amount of food and beer or a party at someones house where you can say we're going to get 10 pizzas and 2 cases of beer...
It should take care of most of food and drinks 
Use it on top golf 
can we get a stripper at topgolf?
We are getting the CBS refund back - got the confirmation email this morning. Does anyone have any ideas about what they would like to do with it?...

Week 3 -Most points in season - Justin 381.4Most points single week - Justin 151.5Survivor pool - Mason is outWe are up to $35.00 in transaction fees. We have submitted the request for the CBS refund and are awaiting a response from them. 
duhhhhhhh....
Week 3 complete -

Just so there’s no confusion, there is no ancillary category for a one week LOW score
Mason with a historically bad week
still in that survivor pool! woooo
Mason with 38.6 😱
Safe to say I left some points on the bench

I'm pretty sure I can make that work.

Nick make sure your parents don't have a birthday that day so you don't have to back out like the Titans game...
It's official - October 15th- it's a Sunday so everyone start telling their families to fuck off now so they aren't shocked when you leave that day...
LETS MAKE IT OFFICIAL AND DO IT 😍😍😍
👍🏻
Titans play Monday night that week...
Dylan good point!
I'm not sure but I think so... @Justin Rossano 
what time is titans game? isn't it right next to nissan? we don't want to be coming or going at the same time they are...
I would say noon so we could watch some games together...
In the bays?
Drinking and golf have been hobbies of mine for years 
Do they have TV’s for nfl on Sunday?
Sounds cool to me
What time would we want to do it? Price scales up the later we go...
I'm down. That sounds like fun  
We will also get 10% off the bay rental for firefighter discount...
It's like a driving range but with scoring and I believe they have a few game modes to choose from...
those are at crazy horse @Andy Rangel 
That's not bad as long as we have several that want to go!
So it’s like a driving range?
Unlimited balls to hit and clubs...you have to buy a $5 membership card the first time you go...
Bitches with low self esteem?
Drinks?
What is included Cody?
damn that's cheap as fuck. 
That's the bay rental price...total...
so $25 total for 6 for the hour!? or $25 each?
You can have 6 people per bay, bays rent by the hour...
Thompson!!! 😍😍😍

Shots fired
still woulda beat the shit out of @Wes Young 
He normally gets good projections then nobody shows up on Sunday 
Have you seen his team?
surely by that time he will have beaten someone...
Paul is done with us. 
My bday is next year 🤔
Huh?
🤔
Why don't you ask for a unicorn for your birthday Andy. 
Cody doesn't have any friends so he doesn't understand 👍🏽
Paul actually brings the house down with karaoke 
Oh yeah!

Hey Justin league mid season get together?? 👀
Gonna make up for it this year though. 
I know you didn't make it last year Nick...it's awesome...
At the 0-3 Bar and Grill with Cody

The only reason Cody even made the playoffs last year is because he "happend" to play John the last game of the regular season.

In solidarity with Kaepernick, the colts and browns have decided to kneel for the entire game. 
That is true. 
Zero is better than the negative 40 they would have had. 
Well good thing defenses don't go negative cause Baltimore's shit the bed today.  
Since I started buck over Howard. He will put up 30

Coach Richard Alexander have to be kicking themself for their lineup decisions this week. They started Thomas Rawls instead of Tevin Coleman, despite the experts' prediction that Coleman should have played.
I'm going to miss these reports
Coach Collier certainly can't blame the loss on Rob Gronkowski, who scored 17.6 points. Gronkowski was back to doing Gronk things- like scoring an impressive deep TD and leaving the game with an injury.
Nice!!!!

Which is cool cuz it keeps you from getting fucked by a defense  
Thanks Wes. That was my question. 
CBS wasn't setup to have defense go negative
What?
Only on defenses @Justin Rossano?
Nevermind 
a little weird shit week 1 and 2 doesn't bother me as long as the fucking scores and rosters load at least as well as the ads. and $150 back would be cool too.

We're switching to ESPN and CBS is going to pay for it!
I want my $15 back!
With cbs crashing yesterday the way it did that wasn't good and the fucking ads are annoying
scores are being archived from CBS so if there is any trouble, we'll have it to refer back to. 
It's for the better
It will all be good gents
the scores will be updated manually for week 1 & 2 and will use ESPN going forward. 
Paul where you at I want to see how you feel
😳
This could get dicey. 
😩😩😩
only way to switch was to import lineups as they are currently
Too much change
I have to adjust them manually
The ESPN app does scoring differently. It's fucking with point totals from last week. 
claims shouldn't process until Wednesday anyways so we should be good on that. 
Wes, you are the best. I truly appreciate you not working today and knocking this out
Switching to ESPN. If you have any waiver wire claims currently submitted, please cancel them. All other claims, please wait until tomorrow to submit

Let's do it. This is going to help my record...... 
Let me just make a quick lineup change 
Damn, I'm losing in ESPN too. 
You the real MVP
Scoring is really close but needs some fine tuning on defense 
You still my hero
Before anyone gets uppity I'm testing it out and there are still settings to adjust. Week 1 doesn't match at all due to how many roster changes were made. 
That's my hero

I think it's been very competitive so far. 
Chris, you poked the bear
I like it...
Good competition 
4 of 6 matches are currently less than 5 points from each other 
How are you enjoying the 0-2 bar? They got good service?
I like that there has been some close games both weeks so far...
Good game though..😏
If it wasn't for angry Brady i would have got ya
😭😭😭
You don't know pain until you lose to the guy that drafted from a magazine 
Finally someone else knows my pain from last season. 
Also known as the Nick 
I really feel bad for Chris. He put up a damn good score yesterday and played one of only two teams that could have beaten him
Paul we miss you 😩😩😩

No. Paul is 0-2 also. 
Is cody the only one 0-2?
Racist Brady only throws tds to white receivers 
I need Brady to stop being a racist 
Cody likes the 0-2 bar better 
I need some better receivers tho! 
😂
Except for cody
Me neither. Welcome to the 1-1 club
Wesly good game buddy I didn't see that coming 
I need 1.2 points

null
Not to be out of the pool this week!! 
What did you expect 😂
I don't know why I expected more out of this league. 
Ok, I thought so. It updated like he did, then they took it away and then added it back again 
Adams 
Who caught that td? 
It just updated then 
No sir, you are very close
null
???
Yes, I am not that close. They gave Adam's the points for td and then took them back 
I do believe it was a large margin
Wasn't Nate favored by like 20 points this week?
There is a sliver of light on the horizon 
O'Cain about to put Nate outta the pool

Cobb has been targeted a ton...
2 more on the board 
There you go Wes 
cobb had 2 that should have been a td in 2 mins and fucked em both up...
Please score and go for 2!!! 
The way this week has been it wouldn't surprise me if he went negative 
It's a strong possibility 😖
You worried about Marshall putting up a 0?
I'm so scared 😩😩😩
😬
I need you to get extra points not field goals 
Right here 
It was over before Anderson scored again 
I need Green Bay to score a TD 
Nah
Naw it's going be close 😬
It happened a few hours ago. 
Wesly are you ready for that upset?
What is wrong with green bay. I need points damnit

@Wes Young 
Oh wait...  he's your kicker. 
That's the worst part @Justin Rossano 
He's gonna have like 120 all purpose yards and 2 TD. 
Wes about to go down to a team picked from a magazine

You don't like our league anymore?
Why is he being so selfish
What's up with that @Paul Miller 
Shiiiiiiit Paul won't let me get Pryor 😔
Strange...

I've been trying to make a trade with Paul and he won't return my messages and I'm not sure why????
Highest points scorer will be mr Wayne or wesly

Oh @Mason Brewer . Let's not be petty. I could have benched both of my Chiefs players, not started anyone in their places, and you still would have lost. 
If you guys use the desktop to look at the week 1 analysis, you can add comments to your section 
Mine said "Getting beat by a real person that actually drafted more than one player from the Chiefs (on purpose) is like getting raped by a baby. It's highly unlikely but if it happens once then by the laws of probability you can be certain it will never happen again." I can't help what the app says buddy
Is this like Weekend at Bernies? He is upright but still dead

Meanwhile, Andy Dalton stuck out as the worst performer for Chicken in a Biscuit, scoring -3 points. Dalton was so bad that fans chanted for him to be traded and even threw things at him as he left the field. Chicken in a Biscuit also had to deal with a poor effort from Rob Kelley (6.3 points below expected).

Jaguars got 3 fumble recoveries, 1 int, a defensive td, and 10 sacks. Jesus Christ. 
If my 5 players that have yet to play each score 1 point, you win.

You're gonna need several more of those points 
I got a point 😫😫😭😭😭🤤🤤🤤
I got Bailey

Remember - while we are using a free agent acquisition budget there are zero dollar bids allowed so you don't have to necessarily spend anything to acquire a player off of the wire...in the event that there is a tie in bids for a player the system reverts to inverse order of standings to determine who wins...

Draft only players with the least amount of hair. Joshua Dobbs is obviously the first pick. 
Only have two running backs to pick from though. So it could be tough. 
Gonna do some themed drafts. One year only pick white players. #MakeFootballGreatAgain
Lemme get Ray Lewis for my RB
Aaron Hernandez 1st round
I'm drafting all felons this year. 
I'd pay a shiny nickel and a chewed up piece of bubble gum

I feel so dumb asking that question.... 
I like "Other Nick" better...
Also, I corrected my name in my profile. Is it still showing it spelled incorrectly? 
Let's go with "original Nick"

👀
Now that we have @Nick Brown, I'm going to start referring to @Nick Wayne as "Other Nick"...
This will also help me communicate better with my children

Group me seems to be okay though. It works well enough.

I set it up initially and I have Verizon @Chris Rangel 
Too congested with Verizon to get any data bandwidth. 
Yeah but you can actually use your phone in Brentwood if you have at&t
So I wonder if someone else set up for the group messaging if it would work that way🤔
👍😔AT&T blows
Verizon is 20 SMS per Group
Because I like paying More For Less, if I win, I might buy an iPhone
Other carriers can text more than 10 for a group but AT&T hasn't fixed it yet
😱
So figured it out AT&T put a limit on have more than 10 recipients for text messages that's why it messed up
you know that's right
