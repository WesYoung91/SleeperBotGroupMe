 @Brian O'Cain  What’s up baby girl Baby face brian  https://www.newschannel5.com/news/nfl-draft-what-you-need-to-know-as-a-fan-attending-the-draft-in-nashville @Andy Rangel  sorry we all bailed on you. We'll make up for it Tomorrow night though. And solve linear equations (not really)  On the real tho Justin gave me a great idea @Justin Rossano gonna buy a big ass square calculator for the ACT 😂 @Todd Wiencek I fucking love you man I wish we could hang out more! 😍 😂😂😂 @Todd Wiencek witnessed it at that's all that matters.  👀👀👀 @Cody Alexander not everyone  Poll 'Do you share a blanket with your spouse?' has expired  Yes you did. Everyone at the Super Bowl party witnessed it.  Never agreed @Cody Alexander  I told just Justin I’d rather wear a thong and nothing else and stand on a street Corner holding a sign that says I suck at Fantasy football 🤷🏽‍♂️ He also agreed to it. It's on him.  😒 True. Also, no one has stayed after losing.  The last three years and nothing!!! No punishment  In his defense no one has done anything after losing  @Andy Rangel Doesn’t understand the concept of “non-refundable” Wow  Don't suck dick at fantasy and you wouldn't have to go @Andy Rangel  MONEY that can be used for LEAGUE OUTINGS  Can’t get the money back Just think if if we cancel we get that league money back!  Poll 'Do you share a blanket with your spouse?' is about to expire Don’t let the white man keep you down.  I tried Justin said no 🙄 #resist Get a refund  Don’t go  I’m so damn salty about taking that damn ACT Saturday 🙄 @Andy Rangel @Dylan Pine @Brian O'Cain @Justin Rossano @Wes @Paul Miller @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @TheTRUEJerk @Nick  Brown @Todd Wiencek @Keven Reed VOTE! Y’all leave my buddy alone @Justin Rossano @Cody Alexander  Created new poll 'Shirt options': https://s.groupme.com/15MPtRI 😘 Just more to love ❤️  👍 Well good @Wes. Nashville Tent and Awning isn't cheap so if we cancel yours it'll be cheaper 👍 Basic economics  Yours is the reason the price jumped. They are sewing 3 shirts together. 🤣🤣 I don’t want a shirt that bad  The $15 would be of each member paid for their own shirt. Also, I’m waiting on the proofs for the shirts, but the design has been submitted. Cost for each person will be $6, but this will deplete all league funds. Not a huge issue. If the league would rather pay for the shirts outright, they are $15. April 25th. It's a Thursday @Brian O'Cain  What day are we supposed to be going to Nashville for the draft?  @Brian O'Cain ........we got forks man  Y’all ready for the voodoo baby 😍 @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot Happy national siblings day love you Bro 😍 It was for me too when it missed the house it was leaning over  @Brian O'Cain  That’s very satisfying  @Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @Cody Alexander @Dylan Pine @Justin Rossano @Keven Reed @Nick  Brown @Paul Miller @TheTRUEJerk @Todd Wiencek   Created new poll 'Do you share a blanket with your spouse?': https://s.groupme.com/N6wmCz that new logo @Keven Reed   if it don’t shit the bed like CBS did, i’m in lol we'll see on opening day cool. it’s pretty, but i don’t give a fuck about pretty if it’s not stable espn looks like it is from 2001 very modern. app looks great. I wanna say third as well @Dylan Pine No. This is their 3rd I believe. If not it's their second.  is this their first year? @Keven Reed  is on board with a dynasty league but also said the same thing we've talked about before. when we do a dynasty league, we need to run a traditional league beside it. The reviews on the App Store were good also I looked through it last night and same thing. I couldn’t access any of that info also looks like it offers a seamless transition to dynasty I haven't found a demo league yet. yeah me too. I wish we could see what a rosters page looks like. I’m pretty damn excited about it. Everything I’ve looked at on the app is nice. I like the NFL news updates too @Justin Rossano  you should have a c by your name now too y'all hype about sleeper? best gif hands down.

Not yet. About to though.  @Cody Alexander Have you gotten into Sleeper and looked at it? It’s pretty nice Fuck. Dumb asses ESPN just deleted all league history in an update so we have nothing to lose by switching.  It looks good man. I like the app layout  👌 Hey Everyone, click this link https://slpr.link/EMzd9MaEPaM0 Whats even better.....where they hell you think some drunk mother fuckers are going to piss?

On a positive note...the forecast temperatures for this weekend and next week are looking SEXY AF THO 😍😏 I heard that  Food stamps don’t come in till next week so it’s just bad timing @Cody Alexander 🤷🏽‍♂️ Rude motherfucker. 🙄 I just want a all star special  😭😭😭 Me and @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot are crying and you're interrupting.  🤷🏽‍♂️ Shut up @Andy Rangel ol broke ass bitch. Nobody wanted you here anyway.   @Cody Alexander nope    It’s the first step to becoming a better person  That’s it let it out I want to feel what you feel   Let’s take a trip inside your mind  How does it make you feel to know that you are a terrible person  Are you apologizing for getting his straps rusty Are you buying his breakfast  Me and @Justin Rossano are on the way to Waffle House. @Andy Rangel you meeting us? He's lashing out Let’s reflect on this right now Less deflection, more reflection I must of struck a nerve  FUCKING AUTOCORRECT THIS MORNING @Justin Rossano Is it too late to change my shirt size from M to L?  Fat Shut up fast ass, no one's waving a donut around asking you to speak.  Maybe we should bring bry into the mix Yea he has a problem  Less deflection, more reflection amirite guys? Your* My problem is solved. You're problem still exists.  #CarpetCleaner #NeverForget We are here because you have a problem  We aren’t here for me right now buddy I'm remedying my issue right now but @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot not so much That's why I love him I'm talking about you 🙄 It’s what he does best  He's a master of deflection classic deflection But what’s school have to do with you being a better person  Working to it I did the grant  👀👀    Leaving the station now Are you on the way to return the straps  I'm right here bitch. 🤦‍♂️ Anddddddd now he is gone again  Idk it’s a learned trait that he never picked up On Where do you sign up for the school ok how to be a good friend and return borrowed shit? If we're just going to tell lies then yes I returned them.  So did you give Justin money  Yea Did you sign up for school yet? 😔  nope Did you take the straps back Nope not off that was yesterday  Cook your ass up a bowl of fruit loops  What time you cooking? I did that Monday @Justin Rossano  #getshitdone Imma call Bry We ain’t talking about that. Quit changing the subject  Swing by there so you can make me breakfast ho.  @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot is on hush mode.  😍 Since you’re so ambitious, swing by my house and drop them straps off, or some 💵 💵 💵  👀 Did ya? Huh? Probably takes the same amount of time as you bitching this morning.  You sign up for school yet @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot ? @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot must be off today. All this time to text. And bitch.   #ratchetthief  @Cody Alexander  Baby back hiding ass bitch You were just mad about nick not going to the draft Where you at Cody @Cody Alexander Why in the fuck do you do that I don’t see how people do that   Actual footage of his old car ^ true story. Caught ebola in it once Legit use to look like this  And his Prius Straps got dumped at the dump when he threw it in reverse and off loaded everything  You should of seen his Camry Been like that for the longest He just carries around shit in his truck. Always full of garbage inside and out   Maybe  At least the Mormon would return them Fucker has had a truck for how long and he can’t go buy fucking straps  we have two applicants already to replace him. Start a new league? We are all ashamed of him by association 🤷‍♂️ Just because  Me too 😢 I guess I'll have to get a divorce By marriage Why are you a thieving ghetto bitch I'm ashamed that I'm sort of related to him. You know those sum bitches are gone @Cody Alexander What in the fuck Fucking ridiculous   @Cody Alexander  Still waiting  No straps yet It’s going to rain today so don’t leave them on top of your rusty ass grill Two of them You have @Justin Rossano straps @Cody Alexander Remember  @Cody Alexander Huh Hey did you @Cody Alexander  @Cody Alexander Did you give @Justin Rossano his money for the straps  😂  Que  @Andy Rangel  I have lost hope 🤷🏽‍♂️ you better fucking study son. By Shakira What was the other one? So the other video is better? Hell naw @Wes  that's more of a punishment for me than you 😂 This is all possible in after effects. I don't know how to do half of it but could probably figure it out. But I'm not sure I want to spend hours editing footage of you in a fucking speedo Plus I think the song is catchy 😂 ☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽 @Dylan Pine  @Justin Rossano  @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot  @Wes  @Brian O'Cain  I need to do video to this when I fail act  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dvxVQp2-qCk that's a cold take for sure. Yeah @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot  that's a likely outcome. 😳 That one is too accurate  In a strange twist of fate, Brady realizes his true passion is kissing kids. He retires from the NFL, moves to Rome to become a Catholic Priest. 👀👀👀 Mariota gets season ending injury in pregame and tannehill takes the titans to the playoffs Rams jaguars super bowl bortles vs foles Tevin Coleman gets 2K in San Fransisco and is the leagues leading rusher leaving lots of people confused.  Oooooooo...hot takes... @Cody Alexander  let's get some hot takes in here. Bold Prediction: Bortles plays more than 1 game this season. Boner storm growing off the coast of LA Bortles beats out Goff in pre-season to become the legitimate starter. Goes on to win 4 superbowls in the next 3 years. Hall of Fame first year he retires. 😳😳 BOAT Stop, I can only get so erect Goff suffers catastrophic injury in first game warmups, bortles becomes MVP https://youtu.be/eiVLSBHVG7I  You always have to finish what you start @Keven Reed is that why you were late to work?  🤤 I muted so I could finish jerking off without seeing your name pop up every five seconds @Paul Miller Doesn’t mute so I just assume he actively ignores the league.  Anybody have 4 friends that want to play fantasy?   He was the only one that understood my racism  Me too. He may have been a raging alcoholic but at least he didn't mute.  Gosh damn mutes!!!!! Now we have a muter  😭😭😭 I miss him😔 👀  @Dylan Pine Probably.  @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot You want a job?  let me guess he won’t show up to the draft at the last minute too? We don’t make excuses in this league  Can’t get good help these days.  Excuses  Wow. WOW He’s also late to work again 🤦🏻‍♂️ 🤷🏻‍♂️ I think it’s because he hasn’t downloaded the app and it auto mutes text alerts after a certain amount of messages.  Already this early in the game and he silenced it I stuck my neck out for him and everything  Dammit It's not your fault he's ungrateful. 🙄  I’ll have a talk with him at work today    My disappointment is immeasurable. Is it too late for a revote? @Justin Rossano @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @Wes  I have seen three billboards for the draft this morning! WOOOOOOOOO! GET HYPE BABY!   My grill is covered on the porch lol Yep The fuck man So rusty and been in the rain 🤦‍♂️ One of them is sitting on my grill.  Oh I bet those bastards are destroyed  Rusty and all He will probably call you here shortly and ask if you really want the money and that he can bring the straps tomorrow or drop them off at a station Bryanna is good for it Yea good luck with getting money from him 🤣 Or should I ask Bryanna? Naw - I'm keeping two of them sumbitches Send it over Shhhhhhhhhhhhh I want you to settle down sir.  @Cody Alexander  Just Venmo the money @Wes ? What show were you at?  It was like a foreign language but it was all English words.  Lol She's never had to say that  That’s real The last show we went to, the guy behind me got my attention and proceeded to string the weirdest combination of words that made no sense. His girlfriend said “I’m sorry. He had a lot of cocaine.” She's had to say it alot.  😂 I’m sorry he does that when he is drunk  Y’all down to fuck 😂 "he's a fucking idiot - I'm so sorry" - Bryanna to lots of people She’s always apologizing for something he did  I’m going to bring that up next time we are out  😂😂 still funny that bry apologizes Incorrect.  Also wasn't cleaned.  Gave it back to me with panzers piss in it still Not surprised  🙄 wasn't broken.  Damn Broke my mother fucking carpet cleaner and didn’t even clean the fucker Lol. I thought about that tonight while I was cleaning my carpet cleaner.  Yea bry felt so bad she apologized for him I had some and I let someone borrow them.  God!!! Remember what he did to your carpet cleaner  He can go buy a ratchet for himself and keep them in his truck like a big boy  Damnit @Todd Wiencek, I traded time with Corey to work for you and I'm at 2 tomorrow. We could've watched Sunny together. I see how it is. 😔 I’ve learned to just say no Cody has been switched from pumpkin butt to Ratchet Thief 👀 It’s been thrown away since  That’s 2 He spilled garbage juice on mine  No fucker, you borrowed one, then another one when you took the grill.  Rachet thief sounds pretty hilarious if you don’t know the context. Also if you do haha  And smells like garbage It’s probably molded  First off, It was one strap. Second off, I have it bitch.   Just go ahead and buy me 2 new straps buddy.  I'll take it. I love Sunny.  Lol I think so. Haha one more suggestion and ill stop. Clown-baby. I stole that from Sunny but I think it’s fantastic and works for anyone  Damnit Christopher! Ratchet thief 😂😂 👀👀👀 Hey bitch @Cody Alexander how about my 2 ratchet straps? I returned that strap. You know, just later.  👀 And strap A hurtful point. Words hurt Wesley.  Todd has a nice kayak 👋 @Todd Wiencek  No. I like Todd. I was simply making a point.  😳 Who said that? @Wes ? Thanks Justin. I was worried I was being ostracized from the league, after reading how big of a bitch I was for a while on the higher up threads Todd is on Fire  Turbo-Taint has a nice ring to it. I may be willing to compromise  Look Gemini taint, @Todd Wiencek already called dibs.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fKio4o88TDA Laser dong is my new fantasy team name. Dibs. 🤣🤣🤣 Sure. @Justin Rossano can be Gemini taint.  Dude was bad ass Actually can I be please laser-dong? Lazor-dong   He absolutely was!! Cracker ass Gemini  Laser schlong Laser was a pretty bad ass gladiator if I remember correctly. Mentioning Florida man - everyone needs to watch The Legend of Cocaine Island on Netflix. It's awesome. A great Florida man tale.  Too bad there’s not a Florida themed gladiator for Justin  @Todd Wiencek saves the best for the end Holy shit @Todd Wiencek that's it! @Brian O'Cain is Florida Man!  And Florida-man for Brian  Nitrodick 🤣 And maybe just add dick or shlong after each one  🤣🤣🤣  And Justin   Since Andy and Justin liked my last message, that no one else even acknowledged... 😢 might I suggest these recommendations for Andy and Justin? First for Andy.  😔 Or we could just borrow from the American gladiators catalog. Perhaps spice them up with a little homoerotic flair? If it makes you feel any better @Todd Wiencek - I told Wes earlier I was going to call Nashville Tent and Awning so they could get started on making his shirt.  I feel like the names should be a little more mean spirited and hurtful  Or Beliber It was discussed. That's up to y'all... @Cody Alexander should have ellen on thr back of shirt Put me size Medium  @Justin Rossano The Magazine  @Cody Alexander  Put me down as The Magazine  to hide the shame Why the inverse? Y’all are the same damn person, not opposite cover his face at least that should work Like a 3T yes -3Xl? get him the inverse of mine I would say 2XL, but I can check for sure  @Justin Rossano any idea what Paul's size would be?

That year has an asterisk next to it   Well the trophy says otherwise Tanner You aren’t #1 in any scenario Brian's 3 at best I'm the real number one fools.

Do we do Paul or Snoop? Lol currently in progress of that can confirm. That’s good too @Wes ——> Snoop.  Cause all he wants to do is get high Can I get a shirt that plays that video?

See @Wes kEvEn made it in after all.  5 spots open  What the hell?! #bullshit    For now on, ya'll address me as Captain Champion  Losers  That's true I paid $500 for that subscription. Had a pro manage my team. Nothing said I couldn't  Better? The magazine was seasonal for Andy but Yeti is eternal for Dylan.  Yeti was my first thought, but I feel like we could do better there. Yeti* @Dylan Pine - Yeto The Jerk @TheTRUEJerk - Jerk or The Jerk? Just “Falcon” @Nick  Brown - Falcon Nick? Chief?   Brian “I pay $45 a month in fantasy resource subscriptions” O’cain  App Algorithm? @Brian O'Cain - Cheater?  Lot of letters but I like it Insulting yet clever  It’s actually a cool one.  Wes bringing the A game @Cody Alexander  Degenerate Degeneres  @Todd Wiencek Big Todd? Ellen Baby back bitch is always a good one He’s spent a quarter of the last 2 months watching tv.  This is just from the last 2 months.   I don’t know if it will work but can you use pictures but this would work for Cody.  Jobless, Antioch, DUI.  I think we can do better than that @Andy Rangel should be Magazine I believe Brian suggested Flex Mex for @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot  That is a great option. And Paul on @Wes shirt Please put “Wes” on @Paul Miller s shirt 👀 I am in the process of making league t-shirts for everyone. Probably a softball style shirt, with a nickname and number on the back. Each member can select their number, but the league is responsible for choosing nicknames. Submit any suggestions for each person. 

@Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @Cody Alexander @Dylan Pine @Nick  Brown @Paul Miller @TheTRUEJerk @Todd Wiencek @Wes  there was a John at some point. I heard he was actually arrested in that prostitution sting with Bobby Kraft. Or a mason  I can't remember our first year. Wasn't there a dustin? Then there is someone who gave Cody his position over the other guys who was that Maybe  Then a big dick Nate Or Dustin  Is there a dulan in this league or orca something  he's my favorite. I only know @Brian O'Cain  I already forgot who all is in this league  lol what the fuck  🤔👀👀 Chris Aka Flex-a-lot has rejoined the group Chris Aka Flex-a-lot has left the group.

I’m going to watch that one next 😎 Overlord is good and entertaining. Free Solo is fucking incredible.  Which one? Free Solo or Overlord? I literally just started it  You need to eat that thing, not look anything up to ruin it, and watch Free Solo.  Did you watch Overlord @Andy Rangel ? They come in 5 pack  Don’t tease me  Hook me up man  @Wes 🥴 What did the five fingers say to the face? Boss move  “How to ruin your political career in one quick hit”  I love it.  This kid is a hero https://www.instagram.com/p/BvFBexvhvYF/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1em2j8nut03t2 🤤  I wonder what he did to that poor battery 😔  😂    👀 @Wes  kEvEn get that name changed yet? 😂 Fuck yea Mmmm teach em young so they don’t grow up to be republicans  Quality parenting right there  https://v.groupme.com/32336378/2019-03-15T21:47:46Z/70dbf7d.640x360r.mp4 Mmmmmm Most Valuable 0 MVP J Rob the real MV0 j-rob a god damn genius Gives us 2 options at qb this year and no contract obligations to either next year. Either one performs and we have a future qb or we go to the draft with intent. I posted this in another chat about this:  Fuck mariota Going all the way this year Titans Yesssssss He was great in Miami  Dumb  Just saw this too https://www.facebook.com/168311766574655/posts/2704382962967510/?sfnsn=mo  But you can beat meat  You can't beat fresh milk  😂😍 Yep  You jealous bro @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot as a kid    Bunch of meanie heads  Damn y’all straight savage to that man @Wes  🤦🏽‍♂️  😳  Hmmm... Can’t follow simple directions..... Well he had a way in and he blew it. 🙄  Hands extra soft from grouting that floor. #exfoliation  He name called first Hey leave my soft handed bitch alone you fucking bully Any response on the name change Mr bitch face? Live view of Chris’s anus 🤢🤢🤢 I put salt in my water cause fucking keto Wesley is so salty 🤤🤤 Chris accidentally hit “leave chat” instead of “resupply protein powder” You can’t offend the offensive  Arghhhhhhhhhhhhh Get on it!!!!!! Get on my god damn level baby It’s not the vote. You’re generally a cynical cunt.  I wasn’t offended weak ass  You misspelled I'm angry you won't blindly vote someone in that you don't know 😳 Is it ironic/coincidental that the two people who were offended and left the league chat earlier didn’t attend the Super Bowl party??? I literally don’t like you as a person. Unfortunately you’re family.  Hush mode initiated You really can’t argue with that logic ☝🏻 Should've come to the super bowl party where we discussed and voted on how to fill the spot @Wes  One day the league will not be fit to join do to what you will have to do to get in  The champ has spoken We don’t need another of these Like
This? Yes So yes No more than normal  And would be guaranteed acceptance to the league. Otherwise he just has to go through the process just like everyone else Does he look like a creepy computer guy? Wes asking the tough questions   It has to be legally done  Agreed If he does that, I will pitch in on his fees  I like protein powder This is the real question ????????  ??? It's just 1 letter. Is he willing to do that? Cubical?  Collusion The guy I’ve sat next to for the past 3 years.  If Keven legally changes his name, he can be in the league  Who is this Keven guy you have a crush on?  I would like his parents number as a character reference @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot has wanted to do the application thing for awhile. He's doing it.  Do you want his parents number?  Keven spells his name weird and I find that offensive. 🤣🤣 😘 Hey Todd  I’ll leave it at this, keven was ready to join last year to take nicks spot at the last possible moment. That should put him at a priority spot.  Do what now...? Did we vote on mason joining? Did we vote on @Todd Wiencek? Did they fill out an application?  Hi Wes has rejoined the group  Muhhhh champion  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Chris Aka Flex-a-lot has rejoined the group Dang, I guess to much was expected of them  Gonna need mo people.  @Justin Rossano are you seeing this?  Chris Aka Flex-a-lot has left the group.    😭😭😭 🥺 guess I’ll leave too Everyone's replaceable You savages  Stop it 😭😭😭 Yes yes I have someone who wants to fill Wes spot  He's so cranky Wes right now  I am the omega Hello hi Exactly @Brian O'Cain  Hello ☝️ I thought it was based on a application  If he's the best fit, he should be in - this is exactly what I said.  Not what nick brown said  Whatever  Never said that.   You told Wes on that 3 way the other night that keven could join If he's the best fit, he should be in.  What were the words I said? 😂😂😂 Wes has left the group. Yes you did I have it on audio  I wasn't done, y'all can bring in the soulless ginger and @Nick  Brown 's brother in law Never said that Wes has rejoined the group   Cody said keven could join now he is saying no Whoa, what is going on with Wes?  😂😂😂 I didn't decide we would vote the person in. The league did.  Wes has left the group. Always trying run shit behind the scenes  fuck this, Cody is a cock sucker. I'm out. Yea Cody if you want to be in control so bad why don't you? We should meet them at the draft  Shhhhh peasant not up to you  I think the commissioners should decide the decision process. All the perspectives should come to the draft and we can meet them and decide.  I decide who is fit not these so called I won the league guys I am the alpha it’s up to me I will decide on Keven later  And? Keven has been on the waiting list  Shutting that down  Family isn’t good I should know Collusion  Also, a 3rd person wants in. @Nick  Brown's brother in law.  Gotta bribe me  Whenever Chris finishes the questionnaire and we vote on it.  so when are we adding Keven to the league?   @Brian O'Cain Dude your video is bad ass! 😂 https://vimeo.com/313352885   I felt like Rocky towards the end  I need some chips and salsa The music thoughhhhh That was fucking beautiful  Holy fucking shit https://youtu.be/eED-CxfFves

I think Andy should do a remake from a local celebrity and it kinda sums up his fantasy career. #creekwaterwhyte #aka thabandit  Go ask Yea he is just hanging around not busy A little long term brain damage never hurt anyone. Ask Aaron Hernandez. So maybe it will stick around  And it’s taking itself a lot more seriously than XFL did  I mean, this guys are gonna have short careers and long term brain damage but it’s fun AF to watch  👀  I saw that legal hit in the qb  He's just not a winner 🤷🏽‍♂️ Y’all see any of that AAF 😂 So @Andy Rangel even lost that League of No Expectations  Technically I was the last to pay Wow Can u give that to Justin @Wes  What a nice guy. That's my chief. 😍  @Andy Rangel Is battling for last place again with @Nick  Brown  #Andyforcommissioner Ohmigah @Justin Rossano  where's the updated list. Fuck. Shit. Terrible responsiveness.

Heavy strike Shit you did it just last Sunday  🤔 Can’t handle it then can’t join the league You tend to cause people to do that because you’re an asshole  No but seriously  😂 Perfect  The guy that rage quits  Keven is looking for a serious league  The guy that’s played fantasy for years  Yea fill it with Peggy  🤷🏻‍♂️ Or just fill it with Keven who was ready to go last year when we thought we’d have to fill a spot on short notice  I’m not commissioner That's your job ho bitch Then you better get started pussy I'll pay when we have a questionnaire to fill the empty spot... 👍 So never  Broke ass I’ll pay when Cody pays 😂😂😂 #pegleg �� 🥺 Even Just forward it to Justin #idontlisten I know if Asian nick paid Chris didn’t follow instructions  #broke  Damn y’all holding out   Anyone that has not paid, please send the money to my CashApp, not @Wes  Here’s a list of everyone that has and HAS NOT paid league transaction fees. @Cody Alexander @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @Andy Rangel @Nick  Brown @Todd Wiencek  @Wes That’s why you need to still be co-commissioner you fucking computer nerd always buying computers and shit bastard @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot @Cody Alexander  Damn that wall is nice  And you have 3 screens But that computer doeeeeeee She is sexy  Only rivaled by your badass wall Thing of beauty Game room phase 2 is complete  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvrZJ5C_Nwg&feature=youtu.be @Brian O'Cain  please keep this in consideration for@Andy Rangel  to recreate when he inevitably fails the ACT. 🤣🤣🤣  👀👀😂 If it walks like a bitch and talks like a bitch.......

One murder away from being a Netflix docu-series  😱 I prefer chic dungeon.  He said it!!!! It’s a basement with a roof  Sshhh you don’t have an actual house.  Bandy road more like it.  The temple road of pleasant view  Your neighbors aren't going to be pleased.  Nah the toilet is on the back porch  That’s a weird toilet  So I’ll have something boring that was cooked inside I can’t access my grill currently.  Can't wait till the party, all yalls food looks great. @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot I can't wait to taste some of the food your cooking   Son!!!

Damn  Noooooo Asian nick  Asian Nick has left the group.   Didn't Todd at we were watching in the garage anyway? We can see the game and watch him clean then. Perfect 👌 Sounds good to me. But he has to wear the before mentioned bikini  I second it.  Ill only come if Andy’s punishment for last is to wash all of our cars during the game.  How have I not heard about this? Hold on a damn minute! Did @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot and @Wes get new cars? And I and the rest of the league really would like to see yalls new rides, but we understand if ya'll car pool.  I will bring you your personal jar of salsa  I’m black @Chris Aka Flex-a-lot we need you to come do to our diversity numbers. I am bringing a Asian friend and Andy is going. That makes almost 7% diversity. We need to be closer to 10%. See, the league needs you to show up Chis  I am bringing Bruce Lee  Chris missed his hair appointment  But why the fuck can’t you set separate alarm volume.   Battery is dope tho  I’m just kidding. I miss my Android. This iPhone shit is lame  👀👀👀 I’ll buy you a container of protein powder Chris If Dylan can squat/bench more I’ll come  😂🔥 no yeti havin ass... I love you Dylan  big talk for the bitch that ain’t coming I’ve been there  That baby life got him eating good  His no neck is killing me If Dylan loses his baby fat weight I’ll come  I’ll only come if the rest of the league gets iPhones.  🥴😭😭 We do care, but it's just 1 digit that is less than 1% of you  Thank you That’s a compliment  Calm down vin diesel  You have 9 other fingers that work  Wives get to meet each other, cigars, good food.  What family  No one checked on me when I broke my finger That’s what I said last year too It's not even about the super bowl, it's about family. If the game sucks, then we will just eat and hang out by the fire  #kneeling Not going to support teams that will make for a shitty Super Bowl They let me down But like always I told Cody if the cowboys went all the way then I would come Brian done put him in a corner � 😱 Then there is no excuse @Wes  I’ll give up my commission for Brian.  I have YouTube tv. It’s nice.  I’d vote for Brian to be commissioner I like it  Brian can you host next time?  Already doing champion level stuff Is YouTube tv any good Brian is a real bro  You two should car pool and head back early if needed. I will share my YouTube TV with you if you need to catch some of the game if you leave early  If nick drinks a shit ton I’ll come NW?  I’ll come if nick comes  Brian takes cool videos  If Dylan won’t go I’m in Wes has a lying problem I suppose  And is open and accepting to others.  He’s awesome.   I’d come it if was at Brian’s house.  @Brian O'Cain You’re wasting your breath  You’re* Truth is, it is not going to be the same without ya'll. I don't get to see ya'll much and I miss ya'll.

Kinda  I thought league events were optional  @Brian O'Cain Remember who is there for you tonight come next season when trades start being tossed around   I think it’s disrespectful to not honor the incoming champion. At least they would come to the SB  We also offered to have it up there Maybe  Don’t give me that BS Cody smokes  You could have rode with Cody. Carpooled.  Maybe you should just start a new league of people that are firefighters and live close to you.  Is a interstate   Too far away.  I can't believe that. That is BS  Yeah man!

Bye I'm done Out* I'm oit Grew that horrendous mustache.  Hasn't played a full year.  Good when he plays but can't finish a season.  I have been back and forth but I think I'm done with Mariota. He's not sturdy. Unreliable.  My phone died - just like my hopes and dreams.  Least penalized team.. ah nevermind  We all. Get flags You get a flag You get a flag He said "A flag, what else is new" 😂😂😂😂 al michaels throwing shade at the refs Thanks alot Mariota.....fuckin pussy And Gabbert ruined it holy shit, I can't believe he got away with that. that last shot showed them poppin lol did you see the eyes again? he got fucked up Rain dancing naked right now  @Cody Alexander  I'm rain dancing Fuck yeah Rain mvp Henry baby Everybody do your rain dance goddamnit!

There are times where we literally can't touch our phones because we're busy serving the public (narcanning someone in a trailer park) I’m all about eliminating wavers entirely. There are 5,000 web sites that give cell phone injury updates. If I’m on a med call, and miss a big pick, I’ll blame Wes for that! If it wasn’t  Wes’s fault!.. It had to be either Nick Brown or Brian O’Cain! Now I just have the Titans left to disappoint me. 😔 I'm going to masturbate with my tears now. Night night. But the QB can score 2 points @Todd Wiencek With the @Brian O'Cain treatment  No @anyone. Does interceptions not count during a 2 point conversion?? Or get on Prozac  I sucked pretty bad. I’m gonna break some hearts and shatter some spirits next year And Brees threw 2 interceptions and ESPN only counted 1 @Cody Alexander  You’ve never seen us at the same event  @Wes Too* Basically Paul  And Wes I like you to Wow After the dust has settled.

I don’t think I can rebound back from the Henry/Fairbairn combo @Cody Alexander your team is producing  fucking awesome just took 12 games for him to get his shit together Henry's looking good today  Or if we were to do something like that I think Tuesday and Wednesday should still be auction #commish I'll give them to you Punt return points we'll have a vote on it during this offseason@Brian O'Cain  Auction erryday son if someone makes it till sunday, they clearly aren't wanted can still do auction but not every day. I agree  maybe we should just allow free agents like literally every other league  What happened? 😏👀 *cheat Chest rule in full effect today  It’s more of a Wikipedia donation type thing.  No one has paid me anything  Anyone can hop on for free  so no?? you know my history of come from ahead losses. bitch i got a loss streak longer than your score so far So far two of my players decided they were made of glass Wow 👀 hey @Wes - let’s put a ghettotube subscription on the line for this week. you win, i buy a subscription- you lose, i get it free 😂    They had to drink it and pick a new gift 😂😂😂 @Cody Alexander That was a dirty Santa gift  What about that kicker @Cody Alexander  The fact that you're at a party where someone is drinking a Smirnoff Ice means you need new friends.   👌🏽 Love me some dirty Santa! You can watch this game on the nfl app on fire or Roku. You have to have a tv provider login  I just didn’t want to fuck with them this year so I paid for ps vue  Redzone is where it's at  Nice  Some of the streams on reddit will give your phone cancer if you aren’t careful  Oh  Does it come with psvue?  I get Nfl network and red zone  I like ps vue but will be canceling once the season ends.  Or you can sub to ps vue if you want a new service.  Reddit.com/r/nflstreams No  Do you not have it?  @Wes do.you have some type of hack to get around this? I will subscribe  Will be on nfl network at 7:30  So dumb.  I think they only have rights to Thursday night Nope only Thursday night football Does Amazon prime play them? Yeah Can't find them  Are the games on the NFL network?  No one played on my team I had no idea anyone was playing   That really hurt 😞  Reminder - there are two games today!

 Or Asian chick Let’s get the loser a Falcon! 🤣🤣🤣 Look at my new car stereo  Fuck you Ellen! But you contributed greatly to the ideas and for that we thank you.  I’m against all last place punishment.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Fuck. Just found out I can still get last place.  🤣🤣🤣 NO! (resumes pumpkin butt) @Cody Alexander Loser does pumpkin butt @Andy Rangel @Dylan Pine and @Todd Wiencek  trio... All great suggestions https://youtu.be/MdkIJm65ytM https://youtu.be/kffacxfA7G4 Duet between @Todd Wiencek and @Dylan Pine  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg59q4puhmg Oh boy this is exciting  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCadcBR95oU&feature=share Gotta do this ☝🏻  https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ I'm also down for any 6ix9ine song just to see someone have to dress up like him 🤣🤣🤣 Can have the champ and trophy in background at points https://youtu.be/0-EF60neguk That gets my vote  https://youtu.be/kHLHSlExFis https://youtu.be/Mx7kzarSwGE @Christopher Lynn Rangel I like where you’re headed It’s a clean slate once the playoffs start  Boom https://youtu.be/anzzNp8HlVQ Records will determine initial matchups for the losers bracket, but that’s it. Records don’t matter. just give me one more I just need to win one more game  @Asian Nick Bout to go hard in that bracket Especially since he's tied for last but record doesn't matter after this week anyway.  Exactly Winner of losers bracket. I want someone at least a little bitter to decide.  @Wes Young  Sounds good to me. I kinda like that the winner of the losers bracket at least has final say on the video. Just a little more incentive to win that bracket. Any of those are good options.  Consensus, or league champion, or the winner of the losers bracket. @Dylan Pine Right now Consensus of everyone who made the winners bracket playoffs?  And I think a t-shirt for the draft is a must, regardless of the rest. There are league funds to pay for one. Don’t get me wrong, the music video thing is awesome. I’ve seen several, and they are all fantastic. If we were to do this, who gets the honor of choosing the video/song? @Dylan Pine is good at video editing and he's tied for last...he's also very conveniently tied for last so... Music video would be good, just hard to find time to do it. I’m on board. T-shirt plus the ACT like who has that kind of patience what's crazy is it is so well done. Maybe anaconda by Nicki mjnaj Not gonna lie I'd get last place to remake a video Last place should get a last place T-shirt  🤣 Stop it @Nick Brown  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v24i9XTJq0&feature=share  I wonder how much it is. I do too I like the ACT thing.  God glad I'm not last lol what the fuck Damn that ACT test though @Cody Alexander with a customer  Front licence plate? We could get a real lame shirt made and the loser had to wear it at the draft next year? 😂😂😂 Ask@Dylan Pine  what he wants to do I’m open to reasonable last place punishments, since this is the first year someone will participate and not drop out of the league.

@Andy Rangel @Asian Nick @Brian O'Cain @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Cody Alexander @Dylan Pine @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Brown @Paul Miller @Todd Wiencek @Wes Young  @Dylan Pine  &@Todd Wiencek  are holding firm in last place.

Bye bitch 😳 My mother IS a ho Stupid yo momma ho Stupid fantasy football  Stupid @Cody Alexander  Stupid league  Stupid trade deadline https://youtu.be/RuLfubSwbm0 Get your Adrian Peterson here Adrian Peterson for sale  @Justin Rossano , i hear you need a good running back.....have you heard of Rex Burkhead? 😍😍 There’s my champion  I'm just over here running an illegal movie enterprise I need @Nick Brown to lay down like he did last week I need ekler too. Working on a trade for him at the moment  I miss gordon I wish @Todd Wiencek would drop Eckler instead of keeping him on his bench 👌🏼 I don’t think so. Yeldon and Hyde weren’t sexy options in my opinion @Justin Rossano would it helped if I dropped Yeldon? So with regards to the playoff situation, if Cody loses, but Nate and I win, we are in and Cody is out. 

If Nate loses and I lose, but I score 17 more points than Nate, I’m in and so is Cody.

If Nate wins and I lose, Nate and Cody are in(most likely scenario since Cody’s team is garbage) (and because Fournette wants to fuck me over this week)  that's a pretty solid yelp review Does Andy not know how to use it Quality is good.

He is still in the running  @Dylan Pine disregard the points for. You won the head to head on Chris so you would trump him in the event of a tie. Basically you need Paul to win the division and to tie Christopher's record and you get the wildcard. I need Paul to lose but he is playing Todd so it's a free gimme😔 😑😑😑 Who won their head to head @Dylan Pine in order for you to get the wildcard you need Paul to win his division, Chris to lose both of his upcoming games, you to win both of yours, and to beat Chris in points for (you're 47 behind at the moment) so technically, you aren't out.  😂 @Andy Rangel have you heard of Le'Veon Bell? 😏 I will give you cook and Michel  16 Nate has 15 on Ingram any other bids?

Nothing like the 65 in the bedroom though.      @Wes Young  I am done with him. Dropping him as soon as he is unlocked  Or mahomes just went full Fitzpatrick Wow  Rams D on fire now 😳😳😳 That's # 35 for Mahomes 😍😍😍😍 🥺🥺🥺 They have pissed off Mahomes now. They are going to regret that  100 messages 😳 I want one  Mmmmmmmm Wow! She is fast! Up That's twice already now you done fucked  See should of took that trade from me Muhhhhhh new guy There he is!!!!!  I think I got ya  Going to be close man @Todd Wiencek  you might come back and get me That pickup  Woooo Reynolds though!!!!  Much better on a 70” (the trophy 🏆 is almost 4’) Shit. I wasn’t worried about it. I was eating Red Robin and drinking a beer. Valiant effort  Just so u know @Brian O'Cain u are for sure out when we go dynasty Justin really likes to flex his power  I agree with you Nick   I think if u can pick up any player b4 the game u should be aloud to sit any player b4 the game.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Justin Rossano you have been trolled  Anything new happening. I’ve been busy  I couldn't stand the thought of possibly losing the survival pool so I decided to back out of my previous strategy. @Justin Rossano   Umm....ouch What happened here? I'm confused. 😳 Change is good   If this happens then punt return points are coming back or I'm out next season  Unless it helps me out then carry on  Fuck that shit Should not be allowed to lay down like a pussy ass bitch  No it was not No no that was a good change 😏 Yes let's vote in the 5 people that are here Let's take a poll I'm not okay with this I don't like this I didn't get to have my return points  Thank you @Nathaniel Collier for your continued awesomeness.

ALEX 130.82 - 130.20 SB    Touché. I too will play strategy. Whether it benefits me or not and stay within the constitution  Honestly I know it sucks for you @Justin Rossano ,but it is a strategy that allowed and within the constitution   I'm with @Brian O'Cain here. He's making a move that helps his team. The $5 fee allows this move to happen.  Punt return point we're bad for me and I supported that change. #freedomforBrian #puntreturnpoints @Brian O'Cain right now  And we’ve made changes to it mid season when issues arise I have already reviewed the constitution and I cannot find were I am in any violation.  I don’t care if it affects me or not.  I support making choices that benefit me. #freedomforBrian #freedomforBrian I'll review and give my thoughts in 15 minutes  You cannot control the outcome of the playoffs by throwing a game I'm behind The power side @Christopher Lynn Rangel who's side are you on here? I'm confused.  This is a good strategy and I am not violating any rules that the league has set forth.   #freedomforBrian  #freedomforBrian I can happily refund your league dues also 🤔 Collusion would be me giving someone a couple of my best players to ensure you have a tougher matchup in your playoff game. Control your power!  That is collusion  I can go put your QB in if you’re unable @Justin Rossano    I would like a opinion of someone who is not involved that will not have a biased opinion @Wes Young   I’m glad you feel threatened, however, please go put your QB in You threatened me a couple of weeks ago and now I am responding  This is a good move for my team and a checkmate for you @Justin Rossano  No, but it can be if needed I disagree with that in a completely unbiased way. 🤣 Is that in the constitution?  In the text above yours  Where does it say that?  You cannot purposefully bench your quarterback. $5 penalty or not, there are other teams out there competing for a spot, and it should not be dictated by someone trying to set up their potential playoff matchups. Yes, but in a good way  Does it affect me It's for the betterment of my team while securing the fate of my opponents  😑 If not, I would like to prepare the reasons that I think it should be able to happen.  I'm confused  Can this happen? @Wes Young @Justin Rossano  I agree with whatever craziness got you to the decision to bench Mahomes.  It's not for you Cody, it just ensures my opponent at the playoffs  😱😱😱😱  All part of my master plan. If I pay the 5 dollars and lose to you, it actually helps me for the playoffs  @Brian O'Cain where's your QB??? 👀👀👀 That’s the same as Wes’s car! Some chef Who’s fridge is that?!?! What y'all know about that 20k fridge   This is some conspiracy level shit  😂😂😂 Magic f’n school bus  @Cody Alexander  You still have a chance to win. Score Update

I is weak Also losing to @Paul Miller has already made me relapse. Hello ganja It definitely gave me a significant urge to eat about 64 no bake cookies tho 🤤 Motherfucker you was eating everything in sitlght  @Wes Young It affected me at a very minimal level 🤷🏽‍♂️ 🤣🤣 😂😂😂 Yesterday I couldn't sleep. It helps me sleep  Was using way too much.  I was doing that.  I never had the self dicipline to do that. I just either smoked more or tried to get more potent stuff  It's too magical to quit  Nah I'm fucking with you. I took a couple days off to help with my tolerance  And being content  Happiness, joy, a good night's sleep, and peace.  And no one tells you about the side effects.  Turns out there is more to life than getting high everyday  Done with nfl, guys taking a knee in the middle of plays now  Check out @Football_Guys’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/Football_Guys/status/1062153734380273664?s=09 Yeah Brian. Tis tough Yes It can do that. Good luck, I found that to be tough.  Given that logic, are you quitting your team also? It was negatively impacting my life.   What?  And to think I quit weed yesterday @Wes Young  Yes you do, they are doing pretty well so far
 You need to start thinking about how to do better next season I need Brieda and kittle to run into each other and go out with a concussion  Titan up!

Now if I can find of @Paul Miller 's silent ass I still have some hope  Kinda like a run on sentence of curse words It was worse  Did he say the F word?  I was on the phone with @Dylan Pine when he got his second TD. Dylan was not so nice. Ertz showed up tonight, unlike the rest of my team  I want Ertz back 😭😭😭 😡 Ertz did you good @Justin Rossano
 For what it's worth, he is really helping Dallas look good @Christopher Lynn Rangel  👀 Even though he won’t talk to us  Paul making a hard charge for that spot Zeke is back!!!!!!

So if Brady dick rubs you?.. that’s gay? My dick just got diamond hard. That's goddamn beautiful  Christopher Lynn Rangel is not going to 'Watch Football @ Double Dogs!'

I'm sorry I gave you false hope. Please forgive me.  All part of the plan  😘 Actually @Wes Young if @Dylan Pine loses, you beat @Paul Miller and @Andy Rangel loses you will all be tied for the wild card.  #toddscomeback  Hi Todd!!! There is also a prize for the winner of the consolation bracket if you don't make the playoffs.  Just like me  So you're out  Sorry. You're not in Dylan's conference. You would need Justin, Nate, and Nick Wayne to lose out and you to win out to have a shot I think.   You're actually not out of the wild card race yet however you need a lot of things to happen. Specifically Dylan and Nick Wayne to lose games while you continue to win.  Do we have some kind of wild card shit? Or am I out? I tried looking it up and I’m pretty sure I’m out. 0 and 7 is not that bad! 🙄 @Todd Wiencek flexing on @Andy Rangel . Todd with the comeback   Woooo cooks  Bowing    Kupps hurt  😔😔 You were wanting Mahomes and I offered trubisky  Don't recall that 🤔🤔 I tried to give him to you too  Trubisky Lemme get tubisky 😳 Chubb and Jones  Chris, I thought we were tight. I tried to give you chubb the other day  Does the league agree to just call it quits and kick @Brian O'Cain out so it's fair next year Might as well give you the stupid trophy  It didn't work on you 😔 @Christopher Lynn Rangel stop with your voodoo stuff   Wouldn't mind another td for Keenan  #metoo Me too buddy me too  Hope you get this win  @Brian O'Cain dude....

The YETI blown out by The  Struggle Bus by a margin of 37.80 Just to be clear, winning money is very unusual. I play a few bucks each week. I never win shit! I got super lucky. Play in my draftkings league. You’ll have a great chance of winning. Most of your competitors are alcoholics. We were born in the 80’s. Use that against us! @Justin Rossano  http://nashvilleguru.com/best-nashville-happy-hours-and-specials/all-sunday-happy-hours If any of y’all want in it’s $10. Only Sunday games. Winner takes all after the last game. But let it be known, I send flys to wounds in that league.  I want to go back to Double Dogs. I won $53 one time off $1. I’m pretty sure I’m even now. I’m a champion in my league though. I’ve created famines in my  draftkings league  Nah, he’s down to party He'll be "busy" 😔 @Todd Wiencek Buying shots next time we go to Twin Peaks I think I won like $15 once 🤣🤣🤣 Naw man.. but yes Is that the most you've ever won?

Mmmm them Titans tho  How I feel when the first 8 gets together  https://www.facebook.com/mouthbreather/videos/403885023414478/ Never doubted him That franchise QB doing work tonight Titans playing offense tonight If I beat Nathan, Can I be invited into the first 8 club? Well, not yet.

Gonna get my revenge there It's just one game @Justin Rossano   Is hell freezing over? Goodbye y'all  This probably won’t last, but going titans heavy is a brilliant play in draft kings   I'm just writing in Lil Dicky on every spot.  😂 I voted Hillary  Lol actually I have no idea of most of y'all's political convictions  Do you??? You know @Justin Rossano voted for Marsha  I joined this league, that says a lot  There are dozens of us @Wes Young that could be me and you. Just saying.

Mariota = 🐐! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I NEVER DOUBTED!!! @Todd Wiencek Gonna go on a win streak!!! Wes has given me TEs twice now to replace an injured Gronk. I didn’t play them either time. I put all my faith in the titans We're a good offense again  Holy shit  dillon is a female pornstars name you fuck Be quiet Dillon   that’s some UCF math He did the math  I won against Dillon,who won against nick, who won against O’Cain...so I’m kind of the champion  that big fat 0 from gronk...

But only so I'm not in last place  Lol damn  i hope you lose @Todd Wiencek  I'm rooting for you buddy!  That big motherfucker plowing through 😍 Hell yeah  The top score prize is exclusively reserved for the #first8 🤣🤣🤣 No Are you sure?  187 Is the high score 176? Witten chews Jerry's food up for him and feeds him like a baby bird. "I changed that man's diapers. He's a saint"  He likes wittens soft hands  Also .. agree and "I suck Jerry Jones off every Wednesday" Agree 100 percent  Something like "doing it after a touchdown is good for the game but he's only in his third year lets talk after 5 years of 17 interceptions a year" @Wes Young  What did Witten say? I missed it.  It kinda is. He is the last one to touch the ball before the fumble  This game is full of FrAnChIsE qBs It's not Mariota fault bruh Just give the ball to Zeke  Fucking you on fucking Jason witten for byard celebration  also, Mariota needs to retire at half time. First, fuck Jason Witten on byard celebrating Oh goodness Fucking hell OMG What a trash pit of a game.   Like this? Feel like Wes when I was playing him It's okay How is that going for you? 😔 Fans of.

Look he actually tried and it worked.  Bye bye DEZ  Thanks for not making it a blow out I got goosebumps when he scored  @Nick Brown  it was a honor losing to the chief  He said fuck Oakland  It's noware Copper is here baby!!!

HOLY 99.06 - 85.28 end Me thinking about Conner and Bell    Gonna be most successful RB tandem ever - 60 points per game with both and they just stop passing this season. BOOM! If you don't start bell this week why are you even playing? As the Conner owner I don't like it. As the Bell owner I don't like it.  that's the most likely scenario Play them both and ruin Cody’s roster  😂  throw the rest of the season away and run it up the middle If I were Tomlin I'd run him out of spite Connor is a stud though and clearly they don’t miss Bell from a production stance  Probably right. Get benched for the rest of the season, healthy, then traded or new contract That was his plan all along  Pittsburgh is stupid to play him with Connor rolling    😂😂  That’s a cult  https://www.instagram.com/p/BpziKcGg8qx/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1j7ccblk2z4as Justin Rossano changed the group's name to Collusion Starts Now  His squad car Monkeys were stealing something in that scene I think.

Per Andy, we will be getting rid of D and K, going to 2QB, full point PPR, and adding a flex spot.   Nick Brown changed the group's name to Rossano Took That Loss😂  @nick @Justin Rossano  @Justin Rossano   He even did it on the record   Here is what Justin said How’s everyone’s fantasy week going?!

Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon. #whencollusiondoesnotwork  You got lucky with that defense son  @Wes Young Our teams FUCKING SUCK 😂😂😂 I'm nominating @Nick Brown to take my spot  Seriously, I would like to look into draft kings. Sounds awesome  You don’t get a say in this. I am naming my successor Accurate I have a LOT of reading to catch up on 😕 Nah. My vote is Christopher. His first move is going to be attempting to get punt return points back back after he gets shut down he'll be fine.  #makethisleaguegreatagain I am nominating @Andy Rangel as the new commissioner  143 messages 😳  What did he say? Inquiring minds want to know. i have to double my points with 4 left to play. fucking slimy ass cody alexander getting lucky again He insulted Justin's whole blood line  It ain't over yet Justin. By the way, exactly what did Thomas say on the phone?  Gosh dammit This is me for the remainder of the year Yeah and the mother fucker never wants to trade  Did both commissioners just quit? whoever the fuck talked brian into staying in the league when he was exactly where justin is right now... good fucking job. you created a monster.  Someone else can run the league next year  I feel you  😂😂😂  Let me go on the record with this:

Fuck fantasy football. Worst thing ever. I want it out of my life. It just leaves me sad and disappointed. My entire team decides it wants to show the hell up, and I have to play the mother fucking Juggernaut this week. I don’t care. Someone can have my team. Who wants to be commissioner? I’m done.

Fuck me, right? @Wes Young rallies to get defensive scoring lowered. Defense puts up highest amount all year against him. LOL @Andy Rangel gonna get lucky this week with that fucking defense Look at that big juggling baffoon. LOL That picture that you sent earlier of the bitch with the big forehead was just a premonition that Dobbs and his 5 head was going to have to play some for the Steelers today. I told you starting Baker was a solid move.  We still in it Baker is back in and threw a TD  I tried to tell you not to play fantasy football.  Big been just got hurt too  I tried to tell you to start Big Ben. Well, Baker is out.  Ha ha......fucker @Cody Alexander  Oh shit!!! I meant to send that in the #first8 GroupMe...

I’ve got an open bench spot  ESPN says he scored  Coleman😳😳😳 @Justin Rossano Murray was just robbed of a TD  I was asleep I tried to get ahold of Wes this morning for like a hour to switch something but never got a response  @Wes Young isn't reliable  I'd trust @Justin Rossano  more than wes Better do it quick  Better hurry  Call @Wes Young and have him switch someone out for you before the Patriots start.  Gronk is a game time decision if you can believe that... I remember voting on this and I’m pretty sure I chose poorly  Yeah call @Wes Young ASAP before the game starts.

Well fuk you too    @Todd Wiencek is in comeback mode! You'll be the second but we get the point.   I believe i might be the 1st to lose to Todd.

Good question How do firefighters lose a chili cook-off to non firefighters  Sheriff's department Who won Yes Cody....we know That's my specialty @Nathaniel Collier  That's the most stereotypical thing a firefighter could stir  That is a literal picture of @Cody Alexander stiring up shit.  Not anymore @Nathaniel Collier isn't he your mentor? Cody and his BFF today @Todd Wiencek U just can’t catch a break.    #metoo Me too I’m still in! 😂 Wife said I have to do laundry and cook.

Looks like I am no longer going to be able to go watch football with my homies surrounded by big tity ladies  Mmmm baby girl so clean    When planning for these occasions, try to keep your plan. Seems like the first thing that comes up, your all over it.  No I must see you stuff your fucking mouth  But stay home since you're being a bitter bitch  Sorry I want to go hang out with my friends.

He's just using the money as an excuse because he really never wanted to come  We ain't got no money either  He doesn't want to come  I just broke my foot crazy story No #noexcuses Are you gonna help cover his tab tomorrow Witt me @Wes Young    Who is willing to buy his broke ass a few drinks tomorrow? You'll understand one day young man Chris, that's what credit cards and debt are for. Duh....

Working as fast as I can 🤷🏽‍♂️ Or you could also work faster?  10.5 hours into a detail I need a quick break 😬  God damnit I don't like you right now but I do respect you I took advantage of you a couple weeks ago, now I am just trying to help you Nope. @Brian O'Cain is trying to take advantage of me    Wes Young changed the topic to: 2018 or why does everything suck I'm honestly not sure what I expected Low expectations my friend  Yep. Stupid, non-dynasty, waste of time ass league  On the bright side, you won’t have the disappointment of making it to the playoffs and losing in the first round  Might as well just mail it in this year @Wes Young   You wanna trade?   That sucks  I lost the only two running backs I have that are worth a damn  I’m bound to splode on someone soon  Who’s playing @Todd Wiencek this week??

Love when a plan comes together  😂😂😂 @Wes Young   Yes, we actually waited to find out when you were working before we planned it  My excitement level  Fuck off @Justin Rossano .....again like i said last week....you plan the shit when im at work.   We will have a majority of the league there. We could hold votes and make major league changes/announcements, while being swarmed by football, beers and titties  Yeah me too  Sunday is going to a blast.

I'm becoming self-aware I've never felt more American than I do right now   Mmmmmmmmm Twin Peaks and Sunday football Actually I was fine with dolans. 5 draft beers for $15. So Twin Peaks for draft? #NotMyDolans Going back to where we should have drafted I'm excited What? He’s been very non-committed about this event @Nathaniel Collier ??? Also yes Yep  @Justin Rossano @Brian O'Cain @Nick Brown @Cody Alexander @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Nathaniel Collier we still meeting up Sunday? How do you feel about Lamar miller I need a RB, anyone want to trade anything?  @Nick Brown Sent me this Knew it He’s just on that chief dick knowing there’s promotions coming up  All in favor for kicking Cody out  😂😂 Hey hey hey shots fired  I know about bench points, and that you have a lot of them  🤣😘 As commissioner, I don’t know anything about Fuller points Bring back my Fuller punt return points  https://www.instagram.com/p/BpFFM7aA_qC/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=q9g256q52ld3  But still Why don't you just suck his dick too Smart  Bitch move Alexander bitch move Trying to get somewhere in life and laying down for the chief Heavy collusion  Define collusion 🤔 Collusion!!!!!  Hopefully whoever you beat will cause them to miss the playoffs too The only thing I’ve got going for me, is the embarrassment that me beating someone will cause them  Dominating the fuck out of the bottom of the league 😔 I'm a little disappointed too I heard he was the shit at draft Kings and would dominate in the league I'm disappointed because I was told that@Todd Wiencek  was about it and evidence suggests that he is in fact, not about it. Don't question my loyalty to transactions beotch @Christopher Lynn Rangel  holding strong to that Transaction King title. $16.50 in fees and 32(!!!!) drops I'm a little low @Nick Wayne  let me borrow some of that faab money Shouldn't that say Chief Nick Brown?  Ole Firefighter Nick Brown at Columbia State today.  I think we should run a dynasty along side with our current  Let's go dynasty next year. That way guys like me and @Paul Miller who are out of playoff contention can at least make moves for the future  If you had agholor, I would trade you 1 for 1 So you want Henry? @Wes Young i would need to replace him with a RB. Not sure that will work with our rosters  🤷‍♂️ @Brian O'Cain have you ever heard of Le'Veon Bell? 🔔 For?  @Brian O'Cain let me get Elliot  Anyone for the right price  I got Howard for sale!

Titans are about as spicy as a vanilla latte today  That's good  I’ve got Crabtree’s old ass on my bench Wes  It’s back up to speed  The silver lining @Wes Young is that, with how ESPN is running, you won't know you lost until Friday or so. I’ve got a lot of stock in the titans. It’s usually not a wise strategy  God damn you @Todd Wiencek . You have me so conflicted. If the Titans do bad, I win. If the Titans go great, I lose.

 @Andy Rangel HOT TAKE! You put your damn mind For a Thursday game this game is actually good.  @Nathaniel Collier HOT TAKE! Dan Bailey out scores Matt Ryan 😱😱😱 Me reading this feed lol  @Christopher Lynn Rangel   The reason why @Christopher Lynn Rangel is silent  I would have Benched Diggs. Who is she? That’s who I would have started  Man!!!  Kupp - Cousins would have been a killer duo this week  😳 The grass wasn't cut low enough  Wind speed was a little high   The humidity levels weren't right  Didn't think kupp would be used much since he has to fill in as punt returner cause other guys are hurt Thought the defense would shut down cousins and sack him since the o line is shit Why!!!! Why football God's!!!!!  🤣🤣🤣 Fuck!!!!!  I thought too damn hard that's my fucking problem   That is some really good bench depth @Christopher Lynn Rangel     In Don't rub it im Gosh dammit @Brian O'Cain  stop it Look at his bench What happen? Why is Chris mad?  Naw fucking anxiety is going to keep me up all night now fuck it You pissed off the fantasy football gods apparently    You should take his advice - go to sleep buddy. Gosh dammit  For what fucking reason  Like why Why in the fuck  Son of a fucking bitch Fuck!!!!!!  Gosh fuckingndammit @Christopher Lynn Rangel Don’t watch the game  Wes had those soft paws since like 16. Line starts here. I've been trying to get that handy since it still would've been statutory rape.  😍 Front of the line I'll get him to use both hands Before Cody gets one For the love of God yesssss Yes I'll get Wes to give you a handy You want me to go in there and commissioner that shit? I'm. Not having fun I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣 Chris' bench points look like Wesley's cholesterol - through the roof.   God please let it happen  😭😭😭 Please let me. Revert back to having cousins and kupp in there He is. I like him.  He’s a nice guy tho   @Nick Brown Chris pointed out that in 3 years he's never beaten me.  Look buddy Diggs did stuff  At least your playing @Cody Alexander   I wanted to play kupp but gosh dammit fuck shit damn I give up after this year What are you doing flex bro?!?! I hate you Can someone beat me with bench points? Asking for a friend 🤔 Fuck kkkkkkkkkkkkk Gosh fucking dammit Bench points woooooooo It's quiet  Cool cool  I meant to play cousins  Can I switch my QB  I will fucking cut you! Them Kurt Warner flashback videos! 😍   “Total loss” is respectable. He could have said worse   I paved the way. Put some respect on my name.  @Cody Alexander I guess u can say that your reign was not a TOTAL loss to the league.   OG Woooooooo Ughhhhh this nigga said it On what the league didn’t need I definitely learned a lot from last years champion.  @Nick Brown I feel like after your actions from today, we should have a day in your honor.

Fitz'magic 😣👀 👀 Its being dumb.   No  For some reason they won't load for me? Are you seeing these @Brian O'Cain ? Damn gif   Oh shit. I'll trade him for a pack of bubble gum - first come first serve.  🤣🤣🤣 Hmm, what a waist of a good talent  My brothers wife works for the Lions PR department....and thats the word she just told me My sources in Detroit are saying.....Le'Veon Bell is going to be a Lion....... That banana flag is awesomeness  Thats the damn truth https://www.instagram.com/p/BoHFU9VA7B8/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=t5b7v2vtnthm This is crazy He just did  And there it is....whoop Oh my, he is back.   All i need him to do is pass for 40 fucking yards to Evans.....sweatin over here Damn these announcers are shitting all over fitz now Those beards will be on fire soon  "Doesn't feel magical tonight" lol he's back lmao He did it again  😂😂😂😂 Holy shit haha[ That was roughing the sacker. All of big Ben was on top of that guy  And there is the Fitz we all know and love man this body weight call is stupid lol what the fuck is with tampa's WRs just getting wide fucking open AB!!!!  AB Fuck yeah baby @Christopher Lynn Rangel  we buying that Out there running like Forrest Gump  the bigger question is why the fuck is that field so small That fool thought he was in a field or some shit  dumbass ran into the wall hartd Hahahahahahaha Oh fuck Damn McCoy is cool Most of them are. NFL is soft that's a bullshit roughing call who the fuck is this team Tampa Bay ain't playing  lmao he tossed him like a kid he said she ain't got no nipples holy shit Vance McDonald stiff arm Holy shit 🤔 I’m gonna hire a bodyguard to carry it around everywhere and protect it when I win it this year.  I rest my case 🤣🤣🤣 I definitely didn't do that. And did you or did you not solemnly swear to protect it at all costs But I helped build the new one.  There was a football broken off of it. Correct. Did you.. or did you not give Nick brown a broken ass trophy  I'm not avoiding it @Nick Brown is avoiding it.  😳😳😳 @Cody Alexander  avoiding the trophy topic  The trophy 🏆 is taken care of. You didn't take it with you did you? Shameful 😔 👀👀 😐 umm you should have bought a case for the original trophy 🏆 to keep it at your house. I ended up with a broken ass trophy. So 21.1 No @Brian O'Cain the bet was that AB would score enough to beat NB if he sat his qb So I'm assuming you bought some sort of case for the trophy? 🤔 We will be there @10  @Nick Brown are y'all driving or flying?  @Justin Rossano are you seeing this shit? What is that number? @Wes Young  So the bet is if AB don't score enough points to beat NB,  No balls Wow  I give you $10 Lol it's a hard bet to commit to  @Wes Young @Brian O'Cain  I don't think he is. He ain't about it   @Brian O'Cain said he was in but is he really really in?!?  ? @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Andy Rangel are you seeing this?    And if I win you give me Zeke for Alfred Morris?  Ooooooooo @Brian O'Cain said he ain't no bitch @Wes Young. Are you about it?!? 👀 I am in  @Wes Young @Brian O'Cain DO IT! I want to see this shit happen!!! Ooooooooo @Wes Young ain't about that life. He scared.  🤔 @Nathaniel Collier isn't even a fireman anymore @Nick Brown. You definitely can't trade him to that Judas mofo. If AB don't score over 20, we trade Crowell for AB  $10 on AB scoring enough for me to win if he sat a QB, so basically 21.1 How much on that side bet  Lemme see them nipples I bet he could drop Fitzpatrick and play Winston tonight and still win  @Nick Wayne  I miss when you used to participate @Nick Wayne where are you 🤷‍♂️ I'm just over here trying to get some side money  Congrats on the easy win @Nathaniel Collier  you the real MVP Hey i believe @Cody Alexander is right @Nick Brown .....but if you trade him....at least trade him to someone that respects your position at CFD.....so basically im saying not Cody Rivalry week?  Easy $10  Come on Anybody want in on a side bet?   Or side bet! I'll bet you $10 on AB scoring over 20 points  @Nick Brown are you scared? Just sit him @Nick Brown your heart (and hands) are about to be full with that baby girl. So full, in fact, that you won't be able to love her and Gurley. I will take that burden off of you. I am here for you. 😍😍😍 @Wes Young That wouldn’t matter.  Hey @Nick Brown you might want to sit your QB in celebration @Nick Brown Did you have Crystal call you daddy yet? Lol @Nathaniel Collier There is all kinds on POT.  Congratulations @Nick Brown! Hell yeah brother, @Nick Brown , take your time. Dont worry about that roster either....you got bigger fish now awesome! We are heading to Texas!  Glad I didn’t disappoint  Such  That was suck a white response  It’s pretty decent. Nothing special.

Either they go white, or they crack out, die and the whiteness prevails. No no.....they will want to wash the whiteness off of them....they will go straight to the hood and shoot up heroin with a dirty needle.  I wanna be so white, they go shop at Gap afterwards  I'm really stoned and having a blast @Justin Rossano , it does not affect their blackness......you will just be considered an albino whitey.  Forgot to like them posts earlier  these announcers are great lmao  I knew there was no way I'd beat nick.

Does it affect their blackness? Ohhh come on @Wes Young ....im from Detroit and i go back every year.

Lol detroits entire defense is black  like a qb prater looks thick line is doing alright tonight @Wes Young .....thats really not throwing shade....sadly its the truth....but in actuality.....they need a fuckin offensive line. Barry did all that magic with trash linemen....just think if he had a bad ass line....he would had done even better Blount looking good Said they've been looking for a running games since barry sanders announcers throwing shade at Detroit @Justin Rossano , Danielle said.....Belichick isnt like Sandusky.....he doesnt like to touch kids.

Yep entire Titans/Jaguars game 🤷‍♂️ didn't see that happening  That vrabel defense tho No idea  @Andy Rangel did Drake get hurt or something? 🤷‍♂️ Huh? Hooper @Justin Rossano  Just saying  Ridley is at 37npoints  🤷‍♂️ Buck Allen with two TDs  Them bench points tho  Cant do that bro.....im the jerk....i dont give false hope.  Give me some false hope here I wanted a close game man why you gotta just blow me out like that Not greedy....he the only 1 that can run the ball on their team.  Just when I thought cousins was going to get some positive points.. he throws a interception Why.. why he so greedy 😭he won't stop running on them @Christopher Lynn Rangel ......you take that shit back..... And leg I wish cam newton would break his arm Ridley just got another TD 😫😭 yeah I can't quit laughing either @Wes Young That team name is the funniest shit. I’m still laughing 5 minutes later  Transaction king going after him  Nobody touch him   Who is she What in the fuck Calvin Ridley with fucking 28 points  I just changed the channel to titans game 😞 @Andy Rangel It’s a shit show. Thankfully we’ve been busy at the station today and I haven’t had time to pay much attention. @Wes Young  🤣🤣🤣 Mahomes.....  *advice @Justin Rossano sorry about fuller advise  @Justin Rossano What is going on with our teams just not entertaining 😞 Watson is trash Seems legit Rookie for vet Why not  @Brian O'Cain  cousins for mahomes Also Kirk cousins is up for grabs Lindsey ejected  Oh shit, Breida is out. Sorry Paul  Hey guys I got a new tattoo Thank you @Paul Miller for benching Geronimo Allison.  Mmmmmm geronimo allison tho He is correct he said you aint got no new truck  oooooooo Sorry your broke ass can't get one You want me to mention it😑 I talked to Chris for 4 minutes last night about the trade and he mentioned getting a new truck 46 times.  True, only seen that hit  It's the best  bad part is I don't see the titans because they never score... @Brian O'Cain  I love redzone You got bad juju Bell David Johnson  No you passed bad juju Or I gave you an opportunity to get rid of that dumpster fire. Either way.  Anymore  You are bad luck.. don't contact me for trades anyone  1 Thank you for saving me 😔😔😔 I tried to get Cousins and Diggs from you last night  Anyone want to trade   Ohhhh damn. My bad. I forgot about the curved part.  Nah, I'm small, slightly curved wood.  hehheh That would be @Cody Alexander  Who is Smallwood?  Join the club my friend Me too You fit right in  I’m not very good and I make very poor choices  Thats all we can ask for @Todd Wiencek Has definitely live up to the leagues name.

Like a video game  Sit down @Justin Rossano , you're drunk I want u to feel good right now Mahomes......  Truck I got a new truci At least let me lose and score above 100pts @Nick Brown  keeps liking my posts. I'm not really sure why I need kirk cousins to sling this shit now No one on the planet thought that would be happening. Never thought they would be blowing out the Vikings to be honest  Just think - if someone had done rivalry week this week they would've given Josh Allen and thought it was genius. @Nick Brown  is still losing though Good lol it's likely I hope you go 0-12 this year  Josh Allen has 25 pts@Christopher Lynn Rangel  how many does Cousins have? Can I pick up Josh Allen again   In Something worth a fuck next year I want to lose I'm style Yahoo next year? @Christopher Lynn Rangel  This buffalo game is quite entertaining Fucking ESPN come on and stop being so shitty 4th and 126 😂😂😂 What in the fuck is going on  What happened? Dolphins had a safety and now they don't I'm channeling my inner buffalo and about to lay the smackdown on@Nick Brown  lmao Buffalo is about to score again ESPN is good  3rd and 50  I don't see why not Can I drop my whole team and pick them up really quick  I got a plan @Wes Young  if I pick up Watson and drop him they tend to do good lol what the fuck is going on Josh Allen just hurdled a guy Dear Deshaun, if you could be a good QB again, that'd be great. Mariota in prime stiff arm mode. Mmmmmmm 🤤 @Dylan Pine Hunt goin big today  I hope we beat the Jags 3-0  while I'm leading I have to do all of my shit talking now @Nick Brown  still losing? Look at will fuller It's not fair  Well should have went with CBS This is true you can't have WR in a Kicker slot @Nick Brown  is now cheating  yeah that was a nasty hit I think he died on the field  so we'll be forced to get a decent QB hopefully gabbert dies but he still can't feel his hand? well mariota is back in He has a great team I knew I wouldn't get that W this week @Christopher Lynn Rangel Should have started Josh Allen this week Bills putting that long dick on the vikings    @Nathaniel Collier Flexin on Chris right now  Is this what it's like to be@Paul Miller ? I'm in a delusional depression state lol you have no idea So @Wes Young this is how u have felt the last 2 weeks.

I asked him if he was off Tuesday, he said no, I didn’t go any further  Even more terrible Terrible? I dont even know whats going on... Is this new? I thought Shannon limited his minutes already  @Nathaniel Collier terrible friend.  Andy is using his wife's phone by the way.  Umm....i will be headed to work at 5am.  His ass is working  What time will you be at Justin's in the morning? @Nathaniel Collier  'MERICA mutha fuka  I know y’all missed Big Daddy I missed y’all fuckers too  Andy, this is America bitch. Use proper English  @Andy Rangel you would like that.....cause.....YOU'RE gay 🤣🤣🤣 @Justin Rossano Suck my balls  Lmao @Andy Rangel You're @Andy Rangel   You’re* @Nathaniel Collier You suck and YOUR GAY  lol.....can i have my normal qb's now lol My calculator has been glitchy lately  Fucking rivalry week! Geez. That is incredible. Per our scoring system, it cannot be any closer  Thats about as close as you can fucking get right there.  There could be a stat correction. However, we need to monitor these yards, until they make any final adjustments  Fucking Gabbert got me @Nathaniel Collier basically you lost by .04 that happens to be half the illegal limit  Holy shit. Nate lost by one yard passing.   Final score with the calculated yardage:

Cody: 100.22
Nate:100.18 Numbers are as gay as @Andy Rangel  Numbers are hard. Lol.... @Dylan Pine ....i hate math.  Nate’s QB points I will let you guess who's is who's  jerk rn Cody’s qb points 100.22 and 100.18  So.....with all the totals added up.....my score is what.....and codys is what   It's actually off of total score. To break it down even further, you can calculate the qB yardage  No. The whole starting lineup with the math done from the QBs actual scores.  We are only going off the qb's score?   It is in the constitution that QBs score .25 per passing yard yes. Is that in the constitution?  QBs score .25 per passing yard. No need for a tie breaker. Just do the math.  @Cody Alexander  @Cody Alexander must be doing his bench points math before agreeing Thats ok with me i guess.... I am with Justin  How about we add up total points, plus bench points??? The QBs have scoring to the hundreths Well i will say.....it was a crazy football weekend especially with the rivalry stuff By the math I won by .04 @Brian O'Cain just verified it. Not sure. There’s nothing in the constitution about a tie. I will work with @Wes Young to resolve this @Justin Rossano @Wes Young ......so whats the procedure for ties.... Mortal kombat Fuck that.....no rock paper sissors....how bout a game of chess.....or call of duty....lol  Me neither. How bout we take points from our normal starting qb.....and put them into the score....  Lol I don't know... @Cody Alexander ......so whats up? Wow  Well we both go to 100 no? Because it's rounded up or down  Now which one of you would please have the higher exact score DISSLY.......WHOOOOOOO Come on Marshall! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! bullshit So did dissley Yeah he did.  fucking lockett showed up in the 4th Throw it to lockett the rest of the way Nope Nopr Well he should lose more trick He did fool. Then I was 1 point down and he caught a ball for 5. Howard should lose points for losing yards.  Fucking bullshit I knew they said that was a five yard catch but they only gave him 4.  Lmao.....

Per the announcer, Wilson is elusive and slippery 😲 he looks like he probably will I just need Russell Wilson to get 88 more points and I’m good  Only good thing that came out of it was Justin rooting for my team Don't know whose idea that was but man that was fucking stupid  � Lol Let's not do rivalry week Ask @Andy Rangel  What is the survivor pool? @Todd Wiencek Is going hard for that survival pool loss   Im gonna need both defenses to show out tonight.....that is all.

This was fun. It would still be a close game if we had started our initial QBs @Justin Rossano  @Brian O'Cain can you please sit your afternoon players? Are you big boy??? @Wes Young  I'm coming Well when your bench has almost as many points as your starting team, you wouldn’t have fun either  I'm not having a good time I hate you @Christopher Lynn Rangel That’s your boy!

Throw for 1, rush for 1 Mmmmmmm that’s good shit Dak will do good let me have th8s Stop it Dammit ivory Do it Put Peterman in!! Yeah just die already so my defense keeps points  And why is Josh Allen trying to win?!?  @Nathaniel Collier your qb choice for Cody is going to directly effect your loss  You know what’s great.....when your defense loses points because Green Bay blocks a punt for TD. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Dude Ben hates you. You need to drop his ass so you don't have to choose. Ben is a love hate relationship. Generally, I hate him Me to Williams and Graham right now. Mmmmmm, big Ben  Can I get a new division please?

She didnt jump from high enough.  @Nathaniel Collier go put a ring on this one https://www.instagram.com/p/BnwxTP2lrfa/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=r3ga6qinj93s https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnb7NI3A4X4/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=hhljkda4ybud https://www.instagram.com/p/BnuwkD2l_t1/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=4d2z9bvw6kmq I'm not sure I could handle the abuse of being a bills fan https://www.instagram.com/p/BnyarBdBcf7/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1i1zn8y5aor63 Justin barely fulfilling his responsibility Cody wanting to do as little as possible Sorry I though he placed him already. Yeah thanks. Ibalmost vomited when i opened my team I dropped Luck and Trubisky respectively  @Cody Alexander .....come on bitch  Done Oh no I'll have to start Brees if you don't attend to it, oh the humanity! Thats fine. Thanks for fixing mine thought. Appreciated ya @Justin Rossano  I just don’t feel an overwhelming desire to attend to Cody’s needs at the moment Well, technically I’m eating breakfast  Did he say he was "working"? Where you at @Justin Rossano , cause we know Brentwood dont work... Excuses 🙄🙄🙄 Working shithead. This is the price you pay for bitching out last night up to this point. Now you wait. Oh my God @Justin Rossano hurry the fuck up! "Why aren't you participating in our bullshit ?" (Bitch voice). Can't even change roster in timely fashion.  So intriguing  I aint scared....Gabbert plz sir Who you want Gabbert or Mariota? I'll let you pick. 😱😱😱😱 Im down @Cody Alexander .....lets go fuck face   Cause they announced they are both going to play. It's better than us replacing our RBs with non starters  Because both re probably going to play  How we both gonna start qbs from tn? Are you in? Thanks bro.  I'm probably upgrading you from Cam with Gabbert anyway...you're welcome. 😱 LMAO Naw bitch......sleeping. just resting up for all the football, drinking, and winning im going to be doing today @Nathaniel Collier confirmed scared. FUCKING WOW @Nathaniel Collier  Wow Faking* You down @Nathaniel Collier ? Let's go! He's making sleep cause he scared. Have to wait until at least 9:00 It's too early for that  Just saying hello  @Nathaniel Collier has to start Gabbert and I'll take Mariota. Just to be clear, @Wes Young are you saying hello, or that you’re high? Hi
 Hi  It's Sunday!  I'm down for that. 😱 We'll see who wins  How about one of you start Mariota and the other start gabbert  Confirmed* Is he confined to play? Is Mariota an option? He's hurt. I wasn't looking at hurt players. @Nathaniel Collier if you have any balls at all start Mariota for him  It was him or gabbert Damn I thought about doing that to you but it wouldn't be fair  Oh shit I hope he makes you start Mariota 🤤🤤🤤  I'm in! Where the fuck you at bitch ass @Nathaniel Collier let's go!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Yes and he can do the same @Justin Rossano @Christopher Lynn Rangel can I tell him who to sit for who I'm going to pick for him? Ole jimmy g about to get a new toy   😂😭😭😫😫 “Titans gonna lose today” to the nationwide tune  Winston and Mariota  Bust* 2015 QB draft has been a busy   Gonna bring Peyton Manning in He could still probably sling it  If starting Gabbert means getting him killed it's a risk I'm willing to take What's Brett Favre doing these days ? 🤔 I'd take him I'd even take the kneeler  #TeddyBridgewater Either way I think we'll pick a QB up next week because whoever starts behind this hole of a line is going to be murdered  They'll never figure it out Just qb sneak every play  Just let Adoree play QB for fuck sake 😧
  Titans fucked up Luke Falk please come back baby. We didn't mean it when we said you weren't good enough. Please take us back! Where the fuck is @Nathaniel Collier ?  Score high baby Yes that would suck  I have to watch @Brian O'Cain chip away at my lead all the way until Monday night  Shit Cause of dak I fucked up.. now I have to wait til tonight to see if I win or lose That being said gabbert is quite possibly the worst qb in the league  Ohhhh shit Holy shit look at that reply    @Justin Rossano  I don't like that all of my players are playing at the same time  Football day in america... Remember this day.. we have started something great Get that hammy loose I just called in a private massage for Fournette  this morning. I’ve got Lindsay playing at 3:25 also, if I need to swap them 😏 Fournette will be alright  Nooooooooo Oooph bad luck on your rbs so far I’m waiting to see if Fournette wants to play football this afternoon  Dion Lewis going to get 32 receptions for 19 yards today And Mariota still "can't quite grip a football" Mariota not healthy Titans missing both starting tackles and one backup tackle  Strong play for Houston D I have to cheer for Dak to not implode against the Giants Houston is a good defense play today  Me too since I have the chargers defense  Don’t you reverse voodoo your quarterback  I hope Josh Allen gets angry and throws to the other team Nick Brown and Dylan in week 4! Wooooooooo Chris, you hype? I’m hype! Fisher of men And I'm a follower He just goes with whatever everyone else does When they said you can slot one person into their lineup  Justin and Chris did  I didn't make the rules When did you start making the rules for something you hate @Wes Young ? 🤔 Theo Riddick Frank gore You can't tell him not to start only tell him one player to start  There are no starting RBs to replace Saquon with so I'm out. Chris, you may want to answer Cody before he cries I will buddy Enjoy having no home button or finger print scanner Sure Oh my God make it stop Are you going to get the iPhone Xspqhbd7?  @Cody Alexander Right now trying to make a decision  No Android corrects it too much for my liking And fat fingers Don't blame the phone for your lack of spelling ability @Christopher Lynn Rangel 😍😍😍 I've had too many issues with this shitty piece of shit fun Have fun  Going back to apple in a few months  Mine is correct IDK fucking Android  @Christopher Lynn Rangel why does yours still say Luke Falk fan club?? Here we go again  All I heard was “bitch voice”  I'm trying to make this stupid decision make sense. @Wes Young you're not even in shhhhhhhhh. I am totally down with this format.. bitch voice Was hype about it then started bitchin    I don't hold the hands of bitches Pretty much  He can't make a decision without asking 7 people  @Christopher Lynn Rangel Will you go hold his hand  Just make a damn move.  😂😂😂 #scared Complains relentlessly about my non participation in this fuckery -call to ask advice of who to start for Nate no answer...  He called me 2 times last night.  😂😂 Now he wants to talk  He was all hype about rivalry week with Nate today....bitched out Normally I'd respond.. but you be a pussy @Christopher Lynn Rangel 🤣🤣🤣 👀  @Paul Miller Coach O is a national treasure https://www.instagram.com/p/BnxFjtQHA8h/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1s8jajuub1ofb   Rude ass 👍🏽 You sure got a lotta time to talk, best go drive and make that money   Running my mouth cause it’s not what y’all wanna hear... shit I feel like you been running that mouth solid for the last hour about this dumb shit.  Hold on.....he has to ask his wife.  We can take a letter and whoever has a player who’s last name starts with that letter, they get turbo... and we double their points that we...   Who am i putting in @Cody Alexander ........rival bitch..... Paul is just running that mouth @paul said you being a hypocrite Ooooo 🤔 Shit, I can’t give a Lyft without seeing consistent messages come in from y’all... now it’s “quit typing” 😂😂 Quit typing  #lets all see who can hold their breath the longest. That person gets to choose who they want an automatic win against... including previous loses Ssssssshhhhhhh This is a conversation for people that wanna have fun  you can’t pick a tat someone in the league already has @Nick Brown  Quiet peasant  Leaves the door open for @Cody Alexander versus @Nathaniel Collier  I have some ideas... #1 let’s draw straws, and whoever loses has to pay double league fee and take an automatic loss Week 4 tattoo  i’m down. #notmychief 🖕🏻🖕🏻 True champion  @Dylan Pine Week 4 rivalry. Be ready Go away coward @Paul Miller #optoutlivesmatter @Nick Brown Is in! Just filled him in So what are we looking into doing?
 Leadership from your champion  Take note @Paul Miller @Cody Alexander @Wes Young  My niggas!!  that’s the spirit @Nick Brown  I’m not sure what’s going on but yes I had no doubt about you buddy second place definitely in You want some of this rivalry action champ? I really lowered my expectations this year  There was a glimmer of hope for this league to be awesome   The rest of the league.... don’t you wish @Wes Young   Can I retroactively make Dylan my rival and change his team from last week? 🤣 @Justin Rossano 😂😂😂 Oh I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say that the players added are not highly sought after  It would be a logistical nightmare and what if someone wanted to pick up one of those players? People worried this game will keep em out of the playoffs  !ididweekone #notgonnawinanyways  Bye Felicia! Don't be a pussy !changetherulesaswego Just saying people have gone 0-4 and still won This is the first time I think I’ve won week one, and y’all suckas just trying to take that shit away.   #truth How can I lose the first game of the playoffs if I don't make it to the first round of the playoffs Weak my ass. It’s truth. A lens of bitterness just sees it as weakness... Neva scared  Again, low expectations all around  Yall crazy..... I’m already good enough at losing at this... I don’t need help with that.  Fucking switching sides like a girl in a threesome @Wes Young  you were just hype about it what the fuck Weakness  Ooooooooo @Paul Miller said it.  @Paul Miller spitting some truth  !optout That’s some dumb shit. You wanna start taking skill outta the game with as much time as y’all put into rules and shit??? The player you drop is off limits from being picked up off waivers  Just for shits and giggles man You have a rival. You get to select a player to start on their roster 
 Correct look at our qbs  So y’all want to assign each other someone where they can sabotage their team by taking away one player for one week right? 😱  Scared Can’t believe all these scares bitches I’m still hype man.  Crushed a poor boys spirits Having to try to stay up on this dumb shit I was so hype for this now I'm just bummed  Me too @Brian O'Cain I’m out here in deez streets. Trying to make dat money... @Justin Rossano .....taking Dylan to court? Hell naw. Dont need anymore child support.....be we know who is dat baby pappy I have missed so much  I would say we don't need to do it all on the same week to keep some good choices on the wire for it. No Alfred we will delete the hell out of you !optout So we doing this one early week out if the season then Oh Paul gonna come in now and opt out for this but where was he for will Fuller last year How many championships have you won @Justin Rossano? Don't worry I'll wait. 🤔 Jesus Christ. Y'all in? Wes acting like he is gonna go deep into the playoffs  I opt out too!! Pretty much. Cody is all of a sudden worried about a loss. Thought he got used to that last year. I forgot Cody hasn't grouted his floor and needs the league money to sell the house 🤣 Justin I'll still do it with you even though they were just hype about it but talked to their wives and got told no  So what are y'all terms then  I herd dat I ain't neva scared Bitches  A win or a loss has just as much weight in week 2 as week 10 I opt out  Yeah I agree Easy for you to say in week 2. Fine with me then  Disagree. It’s still one non-conference game  That's what I was saying maybe just do a set week We are going to have to shuffle the schedule if we are going to do this. I play @Nick Wayne week 10. Can't be fucking around then. Lol I ain't @Andy Rangel  @Nathaniel Collier he is on the phone with Bry right now to see if he is allowed to participate hold please  @Nathaniel Collier You gonna battle Dylan for baby daddy rights?  @Cody Alexander .....sorry Ellen....i am THE jerk.... The face Paul made when he read the thread  Savage Oh daamn @Justin Rossano  Be careful  Serial killer Andy’s rival is job security  @Justin Rossano  Where is @Andy Rangel ‘s shit talking ass? 😭😭😭 But @Cody Alexander was right, my only real rival is the first round of the playoffs I can’t like this enough ☝🏻 Let’s go @Cody Alexander! Everyone loves me  I have no rivals Wes, who ya got? Paul? Andy? One early week that don't really matter  I love it  You damn right! Yes Lol is this really happening??? Oh shit!!!!!!   So I had a friend, who was a really good person, that choked the shit out of a mentally handicapped kid at Whites Creek in a fight once. Due to seeing how terrible he felt after - I pick @Nick Wayne if he's down. I would like @Nick Wayne as my rival because he can't beat me  And fuck you @Cody Alexander  that was rude  I just caught up  Who is Todd going against  @Todd Wiencek  Rivalry week!!!!  Where is everybody at???? Where is @Wes Young  Cody, you versus Asian Nick or Andy But they both need to agree Paul doesn't get to choose - it's Wes. Come on now. @Paul Miller Who you wanna go after?? SHIIIIITTTTT I said smart ass not asshole. Nah. Collier wins easily. You don’t get to be “The Jerk” without earning it @Andy Rangel vs the magazine? Me and @Nathaniel Collier for the smart ass award? No just meant now You talking about preseason @Christopher Lynn Rangel ? Yes. As early as possible Or should we do one early week?  And need to be toward the beginning of the season.  Correct  It's only one game out of the season @Paul Miller Who’s your rival? Call em out! @Paul Miller 🤣🤣🤣 😂😂 So far just sounds like not an awesome thing  Aw naw - y'all getting charged for it. 😐 @Christopher Lynn Rangel You my boy BLUE! Hell yeah baby! 😱😱😱 @Brian O'Cain vs @Nick Brown  for who should have really got the shift chief job lmao Also, this does not count as a transaction   Oh shit I like Wes and himself in the first round of the playoffs.  Put it in the constitution  We need to get this on paper I like Wes and Nate as rivals @Christopher Lynn Rangel I will go in and manually adjust the rosters now. Hype as fuck Shit just got real I’m dropping Wentz. Same deal I will make sure nobody does. Deal I'm dropping tyrod so no one pick up  This is the best thing to happen to our league Alright fuck it get dak Alfred??? Who does @Brian O'Cain play? Correct. Has to be a starter No third string RBs or anything like that. But it has to be a starter not a questionable player  You are allowed to pick one player  For you @Christopher Lynn Rangel Come on Can I pick a different qb hahaha or that Set em up... I’ll knock em down could have everyone do it that same week with whoever they play Dylan and Nate. Battle for paternal rights to Dylan’s baby Paul Oh yeah! Wes and Pail! #twins Chris and Justin
Wes and Paul I’m in baby! Pencil that game in Who wants some??? But once established, it would be epic!  Has to be someone who will play. Establishing a rivalry would be the only difficult part Has to be done in the earliest game you play if you happen to be in the same division.  Flex Bros=rivalry We need to establish rivalry first @Christopher Lynn Rangel Let’s gooooooo True. 🤔 The shit talking that took place last year was excellent Lol why @Nick Wayne ? Dammit Cody, your rival has to be @Nick Wayne  This is brilliant I’m so fucking psyched right now That's perfect. You get to add them back for free after the week. How about you can drop who you need to, but they are off limits? Rivalry week! Determine rivals and you get to pick a starting player for them. Only once a season though. WOOOOOOOOO! I ain’t backpedaling  Only if I don't have to drop anyone  But but but Come on. We could be the start of something amazing for this league Damnit Stop it Justin  Dak will go iff Lol naw I can't  Im about to go get Dak 🤢 Yes sir Is Josh Allen starting?   @Christopher Lynn Rangel We doing this?!?! I am totally down with this format. Brilliant!   Deal! You play Josh Allen  Dak throws for 400 yards and 6 TDs  Go play dak Who you want me to start buddy?

Paying to see Brady not Titans  Seats 5 and 6 Section 133 row L Titans game gonna be worth a Wendy's double cheeseburger after we lose the next 6 games  🤢🤢🤢 Cause it's the pats They are going for 400 a seat that game 200 each 😂😂😂 Where are the seats? So they just sell them  My girls grandmother never goes to the games  200 each Who wants 2 tickets  Titans game vs patriots Shots fired RIP Dez Bryant😥  Coming to the next superbowl 👀  @Todd Wiencek  That about 4 of them jars  @Nick Brown .....how much for 5lbs of honey?   🤣🤣🤣  These hurt my eyes and my soul.   https://uproxx.com/sports/donald-trump-nfl-logos/4/ 😔😭😫 @Cody Alexander  AJ mother fucking Green!!! 😱😱😱 Throw in a pack of cigarettes and a chocolate chip cookie and you got a deal. & 3 hubcaps 37 packs of chiclets right now!! 😂😂😂 😂 🙄 😳 @Paul Miller have you heard of Le'Veon Bell? 🤔🔔🤔 Lets trade! Mixon runs like Le'Veon.  � 😂😂😂  Ryan Fitz 😂 You’re racist  @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Andy Rangel  Seriously though i made the tournament. If anyone has a draftkings  account give me your username and I’ll invite you.   No worries  Rodgers is always ready  @Andy Rangel Goin through them magazines right now.  @Andy Rangel  � Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  @Todd Wiencek I like it and I trust you. Mmmmm them bench point tho  Good call 👍 I’m 🤔 about starting dalton   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 What time does the game start     @Todd Wiencek is also selling essential oil on the side.  5 is good with me. You can do it through draftkings but they take 10%  @Nick Brown is thinking $1000 a week. I'm down. But probably for $5. I don't have Captain's money Todd. If you guys want, I can set up a private DraftKings game every Sunday. If you want to play that week you send $10 (or more less) to my paypal. 100% of the money goes to the winner after the last Sunday night game. I’ve been doing it the last few years and it’s really fun. You get a new team each week. You can also skip weeks that you don’t feel like doing it. I promise I won’t Bernie madoff the money  My defense is going to go negative tonight. The only reason I did it is because I have AJ on my league team.  🤣 I always struggle with starting the lord of gingers at QB..but that big, ugly, rock chuckin, bastard, comes through often  Don't be bitter bitch @Christopher Lynn Rangel  Probably should've spent more than a dollar.   I'll be there in the ring  Lucky   Whose coming with me? Boyd’s only 6% owned. You might win some cash money homie  I also played the Ravens D so it evened out for you. So aggressive.  Well @Cody Alexander ....i prolly would had punched you in the face for playing Green tonight lol I'm only winning 5 right now Awww fuck yeah baby @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Todd Wiencek look at the top! Shit man. I wish I would've known earlier. I would come down and see you that's only like 20 minutes from the house.

Look he's fine! He staying uhh ummm uh relaxed for his comeback.  Shit. I totally forgot about that random dude @Andy Rangel 🤣🤣🤣  True story  Pain is temporary. Legends never die @Nick Brown  Crystal is currently domestic abusing @Nick Brown for pricing the plane ticket for it. It was a newborn 😍 The trophy was just a baby there   Lol 😂  I have already warned Nicole, when I win it...... You better get a picture of it with the pilot, in the cockpit It’s for her not me. I’ll just keep saying that when I have to pay the extra 800$ for an extra plan ticket so it can sit beside me It’ll be a sight for sore eyes down there! Exactly.  But your child will appreciate it forever. Fo Sho. Crystal is gonna be pissed  Take it by AT&T stadium. They would like to see a championship trophy there again. Gotta go to Texas! Is it going to Texas? More importantly, is this photo going to be pictured with the new baby? Mayor!  I’m gonna get a pic with the mayor holding it I’m looking forward to that sweet sweet glow of continuously changing colored lights lulling me to sleep as a enjoy sweet victory!! Next time someone from the league works on B shift you should have them polish it.  May get a pic with it at every station  Can you let it ride shotgun in Car 3? I’m gonna take it and put it in shift chief office 2morrow.  @Nick Brown  🤩🤤 Precious!!!!  Who needs teeth anyway?? @Nick Brown  Nah, he’s got big money. No need to fool around with meth  And meth while you’re at it... Do the opposite of Cody. Win championships, get money, fuck bitches 👍  Stick to the plan Nick I see @Nick Brown has no time for your petty antics. Yea Cody that was harsh!   I damn sure ain’t included then... Hey, you could go get Blount. I just dropped him. He will score more than Bell Ouch! This is a champions conversation. You have no place here. Unless you want Dez I will let that sumbitch rot and die on my bench before I trade him. I reference David Johnson My vote is Dez.  If Cody trades him, Bell will start the next week Now we're talking Nick. Finally a deal that makes sense. Send it over. Ima say Dez! This is Dynasty league right? Who plays first....Dez or Bell? I was thinking 🤔 a Dez <> Bell trade.  (I type while gently weeping) Bwahahahaha!! Don’t be bitter  Shhhhhhhhh... And you could have gotten LeVeon for less @Nick Brown where is Dez playing? 🤔 HA bitches!!!!!!!!! Damn!  All y’all suckas wanted ole Kenny!!!! @Justin Rossano could've gotten Desean for $3. 😏 And I’ve always had a way with the ladies too!!! That looks just like me @Nick Brown !

Dawson is a lineman lol Barely hey stafford is finally in the black for this game lay off him 😂😂 It's your son a better QB than Stafford?  Im a proud dad tonight.

I'm out  Texas time I’m probably not going to commit. To close to I’m working  So is anyone interested ? I was just thinking 🤔 how the hell did nobody get a snap of the chick that licked the trophy 🏆 from the bottom to the top after the draft??  I totally missed it! 🤔 I figured Sunday. What day?   Dolan’s!! Yo yo yo next week we were planning to get together and hangout and watch some football. I've offered up my house but I'm also open to maybe just meeting up somewhere to get some beers and watch more in the middle.  🤤  We need this guy back. You need a snickers
 Snap out of it champ....  Ouch   What is going on with our champion?  Correct Am? I think 9:10 @Nick Brown  What time does the game start? Hahahah, hahaha, hahah, she said bone
 Kind of a turn on How bout this chick commentator Lions kicker right now. He might get cut for Dan baily tomorrow   Lions kicker just realized he is too old to kick Fuck you Wes. I like your commentary Chris
 Not sure if smart ass or legit All those people have is Eminem, the Lions, and economic depression - they can boo. 😳 Thanks for Commentating the game Chris  Would you expect anything else from people that live in Detroit? That's bad 😳😱 Lions fans booing   I'd rather have gABbeRt Either that or browns  Chris you should be an Atlanta fan with me this season. Julio, Sanu, Freeman and Coleman. It'll be cool. Reeling * I'm just feeling you in   looks like you’re well on your way to that 50+ points @Wes Young  Titans are the same way Golladay going to play both sides of the ball now That's how I feel about the cowboys right now Don't want any part of this dumpster fire offense.  🤷‍♂️ Damn Popped He got pipped I wish they could kick field goals like they do kickoffs. 80 yards field goals would be awesome.  Sweet Bench points
 Season opener Since when did they start doing two games  Crowell just fell forward 12 yards I don't have stafford. I have Alex Smith  Bryanna just asked who had Stafford and said I bet they're terrified every time he throws 🤣🤣🤣 Also stafford will be on waivers Wednesday Detroit forgot how to catch  Oh no - I'm a much better on the organ.

She is fantastic.....at times   Golden Tate  I don't care who he throws to as long as he gets me a victory. And not Marvin Jones  As long as Stafford throws to Golden Tate all night A-A-RON 😍😍😍 A-Aron was ballin out last night unless Stafford channels his inner Fitzpatrick and gets me 50 points tonight I still had hope I could pull out a win until that stupid cocksucker A A Ron came back and threw a bomb to Cobb. @Justin Rossano that's my plan as well @Andy Rangel    It’s called the @Nick Brown method Nah, last 2 years I won week 1, and couldn’t finish in the playoffs. Trying something new this year. @Justin Rossano better be getting someone to Miagi Matt Praters leg for some points tonight.

They better fine and suspend him Lol Titans subreddit got em     @Andy Rangel ....you still have a chance to reach your projected points this week.  Bucs coach called it Fitz-magic Strong beard though  I’m pretty sure that Fitzpatrick is Rossano with a fake beard   My tv cut off the titans game and cut to sinbad    Let’s get this roast started people LETS GO WOOOOOOO How about mother fucking Ryan Fitzpatrick is going to beat Andy’s team, by himself Game of the week right here folks  Not gonna happen.

I'll pick you up in an hour. Take both of his ankles  My Atlanta fandom is confirmed. We should form a mob and meet gabbert at the airport Fox was trying to save us and our spirits. 😭 I've seen enough Fox had seen enough  What the fuck happened to the game? On the real...I look like Vrabel right now Titans coach looks SAD AF  Both of them  Vrabel wants to cry Take gabberts ankle You shut your whore mouth God give us back Walker and take Lewis 🙏🏽 @Todd Wiencek thats what i used to tell @Cody Alexander when i would travel to station 2 to be captain.  😂😂😭😭😭😭😭  Yea my spirits are shattered.

Gabbert is trying his hardest to lose us this game  That's a first That vrabel defense tho Mmmm   #missedopportunity That's probably true 🤔😂😂 Waiting to break 50 like  During the 2 weather delays, the Titans could have signed and flew Jay Cutler to Miami. Like Luke Falk  Might want to think about drafting a good fucking quarterback Maybe a little RPO action  They might wanna think about putting that guy in on offense FUCK YEAH! Titans still got a little fight in them MC Beasley was a steal  IDK who the fuck Jennings is but got damn!!!! RPO is the NFL version of the Meow game from Super Troopers I've heard it all weekend  Is RPO this year's broadcaster buzzword?

PB&J's lol Titans and Dolphins eating Sunday dinner right now  Okay Lmao.....only if you change 3+ players.  Can we get one lineup Mulligan a year? "Adrian is the starter. Thompson won't get many chances. Sit him and play Sammy Watkins ." @Nathaniel Collier Sanders is looking good. Good flex 💪  We should just eliminate Miami from the NFL  The person that designed a stadium in MIAMI FLORIDA that didnt make it with a roof should be shot Everybody getting hurt What the hell? It will just get delayed  None of them  @Nick Brown - Nick Wayne and Todd What Titans game are we all going to? #leagueouting 😭😫😭 Chris Carson hurdles the fuck out of a guy  Who’s in my division @Cody Alexander  I’m really banking on Monday night  My season has already ended so I’m just here  What times do the games start? jr programmer !wes iwes  Burning Cleveland down is actually a win for the city of Cleveland... 😂 Mmm bench points  In their eyes, that’s a win  Cleveland didn't win but they also didn't lose 🤔 But really 😡 😂 I'll give you that one @Andy Rangel  Hue Jackson has the biggest set of blue balls right now  ANOTHER WEATHER DELAY Whaaaaaaat the fuuuuuuuuck Blocked Oh no  Either way they actually lose Lmao They will burn the city down Oh my God  Cleveland is going to do it  It describes my emotional state down to the T  Bad form  Over used gif of the day  Big Ben likes throwing to the other team Just give the fucking ball to DRAKE Woooo worth the money  Fuck yeah Butler!

It wasn’t really alive in this game yet  Run game just died with this stupid fucker in at qb  At least I don't have to hope for bLaInE gAbBeRt to do something.  Why does everything I love die?

Landry getting them receptions  Haven't won a game since 2016 lol  Haven't won a season opener in 13 years  I'm rooting for Cleveland so hard right now   Oh shit it is... That was a crazy game @Cody Alexander You remember that Saints/Giants game from a couple years ago that went into OT? This saints game is a mirror image  No points Big  Dammit Lewis cock blocking fucker Punt return Hill Josh Gordon 😍😍😍 I know they keep going for 2 so I don't get the extra points  I can’t be happy for you @Nathaniel Collier  Saints are trying to come back. 40-48 now. I hope the Cleveland game goes to OT so they can not throw it to AB for another quarter What about Mike Evans with 24 on the board? 😂 Woooo I hope Gore retires before the game starts back up  @Cody Alexander 😂😂😂 @Andy Rangel  i’m still waiting He's about to drop 37 points in @Dylan Pine  Dion Lewis was reevaluating his life goals during the break.  Getting ready to start back @Wes Young  Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse....ZEEK is about to fuck me stupid 😭😭😭 How long does a game have to be delayed before it is just cancelled? 😳 @Andy Rangel Could have Fitz, and it still wouldn’t help Exactly.  Next week he will get 4.9 points for 50% of leagues  Probably started in 0.1% of leagues Damn man Fitz with the bonus points Man Cleveland is giving the Steelers hell At this pace   Sunday night football will also include the Titans game  He'll won't combine the next three weeks to have that many points. Bold prediction 😂 Ryan Fitzpatrick currently has 54.3 points. 😳 @Christopher Lynn Rangel they are going to Odell in crunch time I'm not worried.

This Titans game is gonna put me to sleep Spending all my faab on him  Mmmmmm picking him up tonight  Chooo choooo Yeldon train!!!! Fournette hurt 😱😱😱 Yeldon tye number one now Look at Ebron on my bench doin work Espn clearly broken. AB doesn't have 24 points yet? Drake is running all over the fucking Titans!! What is going on Working good here  Same damn thing. Thought they were 1 in the same.... @Nathaniel Collier it's @Andy Rangel  who doesn't work.  That's just mean Mine wasn't either.

The live matchup isn't working My app ain't working right    @Todd Wiencek , Conner Barth....kicker for Chicago? I mean i can pick him up and we can figure out a trade... Back to our regularly scheduled football Should have went with CBS Shows Collins losing points  I do want to thank @Nick Brown for the draft day honey. My sons allergies have been almost wiped out completely  Mine has been acting up too Any running back is good with Pittsburgh  I think ESPN is locked up. It shows I only have 2.1 Who is she? 🤔 Le'veon bell? Who's she? Conner? I want Conner  @Todd Wiencek where you at? AB finally got a catch  Can I just go ahead and give you the win right now @Brian O'Cain  Bench points baby This tenders from McDonald's are the shit Luck got his first TD  I almost picked him up twice this week but no one I wanted to drop Someone dropped him Nobody has him😱😱 Stills!?!?!  Man who could have seen that coming??? Watson struggling  Yep Frank Gore still got it Naw homie  Y'all not getting my texts I've been talking   Cousins throwing to the totally wrong guy!!!!! That's a bullshit call  @Dylan Pine how's the babe  @Dylan Pine Need you to have a talk with your qb... I'm probably gonna start out 0-1 @Christopher Lynn Rangel Where’s that week one voodoo? @Todd Wiencek is betting it all on the Titans   Last year I start out 0-4 @Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Christopher Lynn Rangel @Dylan Pine @Nick Brown @Nick Wayne @Todd Wiencek  @Nick Brown is hiding in shame  Where the hell is chris hogan????? Cody just woke up Where the hell is the rest of the league at?!?! All in favor to draft at bww next year Good shit That b Dubs commercial 😂😂😂 Winston so sucks! That beard... He's like an old Norse Viking  LMAO he looks old as fuck  Fucking crazy Fitzpatrick gonna take Winston’s job All the cool QBs are throwing interceptions today  Fitzpatrick doing work They're trying to be the falcons  They have all the momentum, but two red zone trips and only 3 points is a killer Now the Titans D is just gonna make it easy and give them yards.  It's cool, don't use Lewis  What the fuck What the fuck guys Missed red zone opportunities  He could of rsn that in Not enough dion Lewis though The offense looks pretty good  😍 me and Nate on the same wavelength What the fuck is going on with Mariota? Two time outs  Wtf is Mariotta doing? Gahhhhh  Kamara with 11 points off the first drive... I gots redzone 🤤 Titans is only game on at noon.....unless you ha e NFL Sunday ticket like the Colliers...ha @Nick Brown with that solid -2 St? Ps4 ST  Henry got that big ole turd sticking out of his helmet  Is that on Vue @Brian O'Cain   Mmmmmm  Do we have to most basic stadium in the NFL?  Royce it is... I just tried to change it with one minute left, and Jarvis is already locked.  Royce  @Christopher Lynn Rangel Do I start Jarvis Landry or Royce Freeman at Flex?? Does YouTube tv have NFL Network and redzone? You tube tv has it! Dolphins stadium is about 30% full Guess I'm watching redzone  That's fucking stupid  I have a national fox not local  So my guide is correct Wow   Yeah, that’s weird. We have DirecTV, and it’s the only noon game on I'm using PS Vue tv. But it shouldn't be any different Hmm  My guide has it on there  It’s fox  Anyone know what channel Titans are on? It says fox but the guide shows fox playing something else  Mmmmmmmmmmm  Very But yes Pay no attention to the patch... Not Monday  @Paul Miller its Sunday  ???????????????????????????????????  Did a little rain stop General Washington from crossing the Delaware?!?! Jesus H Christ It won't stop fucking raining  Doesn't look like I'll be smoking today  Mmmhmmm  @Christopher Lynn Rangel Where ready??  Hot take, @Cody Alexander is offering blow jobs and anal for a trade on Bell @Justin Rossano this is why I hate this idiot. @Christopher Lynn Rangel  Where you at?? Time to pay the piper!!  @Justin Rossano you fancy motherfucker  Todd Glen is jealous  How super white people get ready for Week 1 I heard this morning @Nick Brown promised to let Todd Glenn set his lineup for today 😏 @Todd Wiencek  is ready to go, he's just busy setting his 247 daily fantasy lineups HOT TAKE- @Todd Wiencek isn’t really in the league. It’s a team managed by John Carolan, as proven by his inactivity  HOT TAKE - Lamar Jackson if going to prove his worth today. Will be starter by week 8. HOT TAKE - @Nathaniel Collier will drop mutiple players on his team to pick up more Lions players thinking it's a "revolutionary strategy" HOT TAKE - @Brian O'Cain's fantasy football robot app will become self aware and attempt to kill him - we will replace him with his son Colton in memorium  However, a most unfortunate situation for LeVeon You're welcome humanity HOT TAKE - Now that David Johnson is off Cody’s team, he will be league MVP this year, and cure cancer  HOT TAKE - Le'Veon Bell was actually in Marquise Pouncey's luggage and will rush for 230 yds and 3 TDs... Where are you bitches at??? What’s the “hot takes” for week 1? Who’s going out of the survivor pool this week??? I think we very well may have did the last year with our CBS stint. It may give us perspective when we go back to Espn  We really need to look into what the shittiest fantasy platform is, then go with that one. It’s only fitting for the league We should've went with CBS 🙄 I already locked mine in for that exact reason I meant 👇 but now ☝️ @Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Dylan Pine @Justin Rossano @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Wayne @Paul Miller @Nick Brown @Wes Young @Todd Wiencek @Christopher Lynn Rangel 👆 We all know this is true My favorite stripper @Wes Young  Who’s she?

Damn Yeah you missed it Has the Kaepernick commercial came on yet? How are you still awake? That was a catch sorry bud  Come on no catch Julio is 🔥🔥🔥 I’m tuned in now just in time for halftime...

Water break!!!!!  That is fuckin awesome Hey  Hi Paul 😁😁 Sup folks? Andddddddd he is gone They we're just letting sproles and Clement open for the main event  Yay ppr He has as many reception points as he does yardage lol They are getting a rhythm Hey Nick, just throw to agholar Two yards cody Mmmmmm talking about Blount Look look he got a yard! Wow fake to ajayi and pass for 1 yard  Exactly @Wes Young  Maybe that's ajayis role here but they just can't get to the goal line  Blount is the goal line vulture in Detroit   😂😂😂 He's not playing football either - that doesn't help me
 Apparently neither will play this weekend You want Jay Ajayi? I’ll give you defending Super Bowl champ Legarrette Blount Also, anybody want Le'Veon Bell? 🔔🔔🔔 R/fantasyfootball is in shambles  I'm going into the season with the 1st overall pick of the draft not playing football - go fuck yourself. I'm going to go into Sunday with two players not scoring anything 😂😂😂 Atlanta D was a good pick @Christopher Lynn Rangel  Eagles are a second half team  Who laughing now beotch And they made fun of me for picking them  Jesus Christ Stingy D Mmmmmm defense  Keeping those legs fresh for week 10  Sack that ass Ajayi has been in on one play  Why the fuck is sproles taking my touches 😂 .2 - he lost 3 yards 🙄 If you lose by .03 we can reevaluate  Could have been backward - I honestly don't remember if it was or not. If anything it will be a stat correction by Tues Reception for loss should still count I think May have been a backwards pass? Something interesting - Coleman caught two ball - the big play, and the loss. He's only got credit for one reception. I'm assuming that's because it's was a play for a loss? @Wes Young @Justin Rossano  That rule leaves a lot of wiggle room  I feel like we need get a league flag football Game going during the season 👀 That looked like a busted play @Cody Alexander Coleman a sneaky bastard  AYEEEE 😍😍😍 You my boy  Matty Ice Where yo boy at??? Watching the game @Justin Rossano Where you at Kat diddy 👀 They are good I’m loving these commercials 😍 😂😂😂 Diggs 😂😂😂 Atlanta D is swarming...

Y'all see that  Lol why is Matt Ryan's forehead so red? Boys two men just got stuck by lightning  (slowly standing up) @Cody Alexander stop kneeling  The Falcons have a rap history. Remember 2 years ago when they had Future on the sideline during the playoff game against the Seahawks because Future had a baby with Ciara who Russell Wilson was engaged to. #savageasfuck 😂 Is this the Kaepernick commercial? 🤔 Aww fuck yeah venom  I'll be releasing my official diss track on sound cloud tomorrow He just said game 1 of 256... Disrespectful as fuck You don't diss luda Lot of hostility here  @Wes Young  SHUT THE FUCK UP  Get the fuck out of here Falcons blew a 28-3 lead  What the fuck Wes dissing luda now That hype video was 🔥  Settle down now.

FUCK THE COLTS!!! also FUCK THE COLTS Damn the browns have a lot of space Titans are right below the Texans with $22.5 M 😭😭😭 Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon. Probably not.  Bell ain't playing until week 10  That's bold... Superbowl is around that time Did everyone say bye to their wives?

Ask him how he feels about Kaepernick @Christopher Lynn Rangel we're gonna need a pic. You know that motherfucker does crack Ask him to share some of his crack cocaine with you Ask him if he knows the muffin man. He and Nate can just be bitchy all the time together. I'd he too though if they had fucked up getting me my range  I would be disappointed with anything else  Yes yes...he will fit right in. would you expect anything else? That makes me happy Legit seems like a asshole See if he knows when Le'Veon will be back. Asking for a friend. Ask him if he would like to be in the league!!! Does he want to be in the league? I told him I dropped him in my league last year   Definitely not smiling  Ask him what brand of cagrattes he smokes. Smoking Is he smiling?

In other news, the league schedule is up and ready for your viewing pleasure. All because he lost ..don't make sense man Just got off the phone with my dad He killed him self Did the cops kill him or did he kill himself? When I read it they hadn't said. That’s like 30 minutes away from where I grew up. Insane You can see the laser on the guy in red right before the shot The fuck is wrong with people man I was reading about that a little earlier. Crazy stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzfK-ir1Zt8 Fucking crazy    And so it begins  Of course 😔  Oh I be makin moves. I done warned Chris. I’ll have a whole new team by the end of this! @Christopher Lynn Rangel you should be ashamed letting Todd spend more money than you on waivers! 😔 @Todd Wiencek thanks for contributing the first transaction fee of the year! Lol yes...you are correct. Just checked. He’s on my roster. Good night everyone, I’m sorry and I’m an idiot  The bidding ends every night at 10 PM Tuesday thru Saturday. So if you did it before 10 tonight - it would've let you know at 10. I f you did it after 10 you will know if you won it Tuesday night at 10. Ok. I bid zero. When do I know if I got him? It probably told me before I hit submit. If so I’m sorry.. When you pick someone up on the waiver wire there will be an option to bid. You can bid whatever you want from $0 to $100 dollars. You get $100 dollars a season to use for the waiver wire.  I dropped Ted ginn jr today, to add a kicker. I was asked my bid price! I don’t give a shit! I’ll take any kicker who’s starting. How does that work? Gotta hang on to Johnson for now. Mixon’s my only  back worth mentioning  I got a kicker with your name on it @Todd Wiencek  Gronk and Walker are on the board @Todd Wiencek Cole B spit 🔥🔥🔥 How do you feel about David Johnson? 🤔 I got Deandre Hopkins up for sale I need a RB Thanks to everyone with a hand in getting the app built out today!

Didn’t want to contaminate the house Lol I had a hard time breathing in my sleep last night, but I had a blast  My costume literally smells like an ash tray 😂 We will go back for our 50th though  As a smoker - it got pretty smoky toward the end of the night.

So if it sucks or if you get a foot in your meal, blame Justin and Andy. !draft  N34+69 Nashville, Tennessee W57M+83 Franklin, Tennessee   I like feet..just not enough to but them in my food especially if they have slave feet @Christopher Lynn Rangel you don't like feet?  😐 On sale at Kroger for those that don't like Dolans   I am not going to lie, it looks better than it sounds  Probably hiding at Dolan's  🤣 Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.

So if it sucks or if you get a foot in your meal, blame Justin and Andy. !draft !dues DAYS MORE FOUR 4 more days guys, hey guys hey Also Weber grills kick ass   I feel like my my last message needs some context. My family was watching $100,000 pyramid (celebrity edition). We all agreed that Ken Marino (viewed above) reminded us of Brian O’Cain. We googled Ken Marino. We stumbled across a bunch of hunky firefighter pictures and celebrity headshots of this Marino dude! My family has cracked the case. Ken Marino is Brian O’Cain with makeup and good lighting.  Did I ruin this group with gayness? When did they take this pic O’Cain? Ya sexy bastard Looks good man Mmmmm butcher paper Foil, could not find paper  Mmmm bend Did you wrap in butcher paper or foil? Don't forget to trim. I cooked 9.5 hrs. Should have been about 14 to 15. I turned temp to 250 to Finnish it faster  How was the bend on your slices? Mmm it's happening I used a Texas rub. The rub is a little spicy. Cook between 200 and 225 until internal temp hits 165. Wrap and cook until internal in 203  Cool cool cool @Brian O'Cain  good talk  Rub, temp, time, wind, etc Give me details my man  I'm going to go to Kroger tomorrow and buy one  Aww baby  I need a bigger deck   Grill day wooooooooo  Awww fuck yea  Best tool for grilling with bugs   @Christopher Lynn Rangel  🤣🤣🤣 Why was that never suggested  Aye Smoking wings and drinking brewskis League draft is being held at todds Lol damn Todd do you have enough grills? The pellet smoker is supposed to be my reward when I finish that stone patio in the background. It’s been a very long project      This is part of my grill arsenal. It’s about 22 years old and holding up like a champ.  Never had a cover on it https://v.groupme.com/32336378/2018-08-19T21:18:15Z/30d80c54.640x360r90.mp4 First amputee swimsuit model in SI...  That’s fucking awesome  @Justin Rossano already has a pair i guarantee it Who’s gonna be the first to purchase these shoes? 👀 @Cody Alexander 😂🤣😭 That's what Cody meant to say 😂😂 Remember knockout in homeschool  no PE when you’re the only one in the grade son You remember knockout in PE with basketball @Dylan Pine? oh ok that one. 👌🏻 thanks The best drinking game in the galaxy  what is this game @Cody Alexander @Andy Rangel ? 🤣 Post draft night goals 😂 When you get "caught" you'll pull that cup and step away and that'll be your order. We are playing that game @Wes Young  @Wes Young I believe we can still do it  I wish we could play that game @Andy Rangel showed us to determine draft order Hey guys, we're drafting this week 🤤🤤🤤  Getting that beef ready  Brine it in a bucket.  The turkey I did following Alton browns method was the best I'd ever had.    Did one few years ago  Spatchcock it I probably would split it in half if it is a really big one  Smoked the breast before. Should be the same as a large chicken  @Justin Rossano is going to go to work tomorrow with no eyebrows  Anyone here smoke a turkey? I'm really wanting to try one. Should be just like a big chicken.  My father in law got a large stainless steel tank and said he might turn it into a smoker for me  LMAO this one has an office attached   i think he bought a piece of land in franklin to keep it on I don’t have Scott’s money either  Nah, nowhere to put it He loves it. It makes way more smoke than the little electric ones  you still need a trailer smoker @Justin Rossano  We bought my dad a propane smoker for Father's day and I really like it.  Just need a propane and wepp be set  It is man. They marked it down $200 I have my Weber kettle and now the pellet smoker  That's all he next thing I'll have to buy. My deck is too small for all this  It's pretty. @Justin Rossano  Picked up that Weber this morning. Already have a smoker. Needed a new propane grill and couldn’t pass up the deal on this one. So my wife's family can stop fucking up the turkey at Thanksgiving They were on sale at Kroger for 1.99 a pound. Bout 2. One is about 20 lbs  I want to try a turkey  I'll do one soon. I bought some spare ribs yesterday.  Brisket is easy So much money  Ditto I'm too scared to do a brisket Propane? It's almost draft time! League dues for 2018 will be $75.

You will love it  Going to pick it up now   Still like that pellet smoker  Look what you made me do @Brian O'Cain   Mmmmmmmmm   Is that the page ?  Look up over the fire cooking on instagram. Good stuff    I use charcoal as the base but that's just to get the wood going   @Christopher Lynn Rangel you better not be using charcoal  Eww that shirt. Nash Villian   Yeah the 340 is half the size   I have never ran out of room, I felt like I would be waisting pellets on the bigger one  But I think thatd be way too small  Ah the 340 sells for 290 Pb700 B700 is what I have  The 340? It's the regular. Guy I work with has the larger one and he really likes it. I didn't think I would need the bigger one.  Buy your pellets.. I'm just here like  What size do you have @Brian O'Cain  Lol I'm all in. They dropped as low as $150 last year  You still the real MVP O'cain True  That's accurate you control it with a knob  It does not take the fun from me. I control my grill  Our founding fathers of time past had no electric grills  Can you call yourself a grill master if it's electric and it does the work for you Should have let me know. Sam's had them for 299.  Cheating  I'm not sure I agree..just takes the fun out of smoking  Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous? Are you single ? That's a great endorsement. Last year at end of season Walmart put most of their smokers on huge discounts. May have to grab one 🤤 If mine broke, I would by another  I like my electric because I don't have to tend to it at all but it's pretty shitty with producing actual smoke Not at all. It's just consistent. Food is great  Does it take the fun out of smoking by doing all the work for you? It's not a Webber, but I really like it  Is it everything you ever wanted? They really interest me  How do you like the pellet smoker? Now it's on 😂 It's on top of the grill so that's accurate  It's on....  Y'all down for a game of tag 😯😯😯 Done!  https://mobile.twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1030614587153043457/video/1 Should we have kept Fitz instead of Mariota? BBQing? Well use to be America's best sport  What sport?

WHERE IS LUKR FALK???? Got ya It was shit  The Mariota from last year just threw a pass  Nah You're drunk  Go home wesley Huh Only missed the receiver by 10 yards  Last year Mariota just played  Fucking NFL turning into a bunch of bitches  http://dailysnark.com/the-nfl-is-officially-dead-this-was-just-called-a-roughing-the-passer-penalty/ @Wes Young Tourist food  Got eem They got shot with meth No one gets shot in Franklin No at Dolan's  At Jonathan's?

I will let you know my review   That's grossly intriguing @Wes Young? @Paul Miller Rap Daily? Eddie George still jacked... so for me the cost is one small dent  😳😳 That range is 2,500 Let me ask and see what the price is None of this microwave bullshit  mmmmm want a gas range and an actual vent Hood  @Christopher Lynn Rangel also I need an air filter and water filter for my fridge. Dad said he'd check. Like two months ago 🙄 @Christopher Lynn Rangel Where’s the price at? Not the sticker price. Let me get that “family” discount I'll tell my dad I want one 😎 Nice  We have gas here. That thing is beautiful God I want a gas range  How much is the stove?!?! I need one for my house but don't wanna fork out the money for it... That shit is sexy man  @Christopher Lynn Rangel Lemme get a stove/microwave combo like that!   @Cody Alexander  this is the new black slate of our appliances   It is the most anticipated day of my year The draft is my Christmas  Aww. See a little tension filled bitching brings closeness. I am getting pumped about getting together with you jerks Big Chief @Nick Brown needs to buy shots for all the little people too 👀🤔... @Andy Rangel ? You sponsoring the mandatory beginning of draft shots this year? I'm related and still can't even get rain x I'd get a car wash from that company if they bought me a shot Those shots will be sponsored by ThreeSixty Mobile detailing I heard...  Can it be mandatory to do a shot before we get started    Fireball shots 🔥  I don't care where we go as long as I'm with you guys And foot burgers Oh they got the car bombs I don't care where we go as long as they have Irish car bombs Yes sir  With salt?  Need me a big ass margarona  I'm just like let's go draft at Cancun  It's bdubs or nothing for me  I’m stepping out of my “super white” comfort zone here Lol Fuck lower class I am out  You’re our bitch buddy #FuckJonathans I just like to bitch  You know I wouldn't miss it 😘 @Wes Young I agree. In person is better than online. Thank you for understanding, after getting an explanation  Even it it is at a shitty bar  In person or gtfo I suggested Applebee's  I'm just the league groupee Look there are only a few people who do off season work on this league. This offseason it was @Wes Young @Justin Rossano @Nick Brown, myself, and @Andy Rangel. Andy found the place and spoke to the owner and set up a location. That's what we should do because hes already set it up. Furthermore we have all agreed since the beginning of this league that our one rule is that you attend the draft in person. That will remain in place or we can replace people.  We could always online draft since where everyone wants it to be is different and sounds like everyone is married to a place... this would keep someone from having to go and input all the picks... Everyone will be attending to the best of my knowledge  Y’all need to figure out how to auto draft at a live draft for those not attending  Request there and in paylocity  @Todd Wiencek  The request form is at the bottom of the calendar. I looked at the calendar yesterday and that day is still available. Nothing’s been set up for time off requests on A shift yet though  At Dolan’s now. Who’s joining me? What the hell?  I tried to call him this morning and talk to him about that  Is @Todd Wiencek even off?   @Wes Young will meet you there. Anyone want to go to Dolans tonight?  Killer ratings  They have one in Antioch  It just opened  Why am I just now finding out about this bar?  🤣 Asking for friend  So will we have a private room at Dolan's  Perfect  lmao, this is actually a real review  I'll let you decide which one of the last dolan pic, only one of those was fake. Twin peaks reviews tho...  😔😔 🤔🤔 I do like meth 🤔  Well Nate is in...  I don't like foot burgers  Must be pretty good if you gave it a 2-star and he found a whole foot That why I'm ordering food somewhere else  😂😂😂  http://www.sportsbarfranklin.com/ @Andy Rangel I'm glad we're going to Dolans. Thank you for organizing it for all of us, even the ungrateful ones. You the real MVP.   WOOOOOOO Dolan's! Sorry. Too busy I'm just ready to eat my hangover burger and wings at dolans and listen to Carrie Underwood wannabes sing lay it out for everyone If you don’t understand......call me but was it though? I made a decision, for the good of everyone.   True. The great veto war was serious. It got real! You didn't even want to go to dolan's you flip flopping bastard Anyone who bitches about Dolans  if we made it through that, this is nothing. @Brian O'Cain  you didn't go through the great veto war of 2016 I'm setting this date, as the date the league of low expectations started falling apart Bring em @Brian O'Cain   @Christopher Lynn Rangel  and I will be drafting at twin peaks eating ghost pepper wings and looking at titties. Cigars ate back in?!  ALFRED IS MAKING HIS OWN DECISIONS! Mutiny!!!!!! Old Chicago it is. Mutiny Well show up somewhere other than Dolan’s and draft  😂😂😂 It's out of my control I won't Please make the change Fuck Twin Peaks. Yep. It’s at Dolan’s  How much is it to Uber eat that shit I wonder  Fix it computer guy 😂 it's alreadyset see The 2018 Draft will be held at Jonathan's Grille in Cool Springs at 6:00 PM on August 24th. !draft but dolan's doesn't have anything that the other places have Nah I gotta eat and draft at the same time  Or we can go there beforehand   Can I get some cheese bites? Anyone interested in splitting a order  With some ghost pepper wings  Im going to Uber eats me a hangover burger from twin peaks to dolans  Draft day is coming!  Soooooo... Jonathons? Sorry. Call if you want more that's not a very good reason though. It* There’s more reasons  Because i was a dick move to cancel on them and throw Andy under the bus like that  would that be a good compromise? instead of multiple? can I just have one reason Then you don’t want it bad enough I would like further clarification but I don't want to call. League draft is back at Dolan’s for multiple reasons. 6pm. If anyone has an issue or needs further clarification, please call me, and I will explain. 😔😔😔 @Todd Wiencek still working on the 24th.  She was pro about it 😍 I still say we celebrate that birthday after  @Andy Rangel Was she okay with everything?  Sorry Andy, I was down with Dolans. I don't know what to do with all these cigars now.  Well the owner from Dolan’s followed up just now...told her we had to cancel 🤦🏽‍♂️   Check out @alexradow’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/alexradow/status/1029746174297817089?s=09 👀 😂 So... at coyote ugly downtown??

In the middle of the table. I had to look around it to talk to him. He kept moving it in front of me if I tried to move over Was the trophy in the room when you were interviewed? He also blew a lot of cigarette smoke in my face   He asked me how many ping pong balls would fit in a 757 then flipped a boggle timer and gave me a dead stare   Interviewing dudes Nick don’t play!  I’m dead 😳🤣🤣🤣  @Nick Brown how did this not come up in the captains interview?  😂😂😂 Why are the Captains of the league not already off?  Sons of Bitches and low expectations  This league is full of sons of bitches! Ocaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin  Shut up!!!!!! I'm assuming unless something isn't up to date. Brian hasn't taken it off either though. @Nick Brown Lemme get a jar of honey for my bday man 🤗 Cody’s picture would lead me to believe I’m in... right Cody?  So Todd’s out? Burn* Sweet with a little but...mmmmmm This was made with STD bees 🐝  League honey will be jarred 2morrow   Your champion speaks   @Todd Wiencek @Brian O'Cain  She’ll be there  @Todd Wiencek Dude come on no exceptions  Oooo holy brown hallowed be thy name  Well said @Christopher Lynn Rangel  The league draft is a fucking holiday Trade time with @Nick Brown  What in the fuck  If you don’t make it, a waitress of our choosing will draft for you   Jesus Tods 😳😳😳 @Wes Young  I like bison burger. I’m in. I still have to get off though. So my opinion might not matter.   Where the fuck is the rest of the league? There's my boo 😂😂😂 🤔😂😂    I can request titties for Wes There’s plenty there for everyone  No titties but I get my hangover burger  Good food. Good place.   What does the league think about this decision? 👀 Then it’s centrally located, so if you wanna go somewhere after to celebrate, we can I agree man. It’s a chill place, plus the private room  Johnathon’s is pretty good  Just talked to the chick there. Gonna lock it up on Thursday with the GM We can draft, then go celebrate Andy’s birthday Just called Jonathan’s in Cool Springs. They have a private room, that we can use. Happy hour from 3-7. Food is awesome there. Tons of beers. Great atmosphere  DECISION MADE! Lol a bunch of snooty European dudes bumping into each other and making snood comments  I hate Fiat fights  Fist. Not the little gay car Getting dangerously drunk at Applebee’s and screaming a bunch of vulgar belligerent football nonsense might be something to consider. We are guaranteed to get in a fiat fight. That’s always fun Let’s draft downtown on PEDAL TAVERN  Dave and Buster's On the 10 yard line  Nissan stadium  Let’s go downtown and draft rooftop at Hard Rock Cafe!! @Justin Rossano  Absolutely  Nah the stillery has the best long island They have the best Long island's  @Todd Wiencek You down for Applebee’s 👀 It's your birthday, where do you want to go?

 4140 Carothers Pkwy #2, Franklin, TN 37067 !Draft  You have a strange metric for success I successfully tricked ya'll  Y'all remember that one time where brian tried to trick us into think he played fortnite    😂😂😂 What is wrong with Jarvis?  Drafti!  That's all kinds of wrong  Wow brian Draft!  Sweeeeet idraft!  Sorry @Andy Rangel  My wife has a strict one Mexican at a time rule. I’ve never tested its boundaries     Todd just won me over  Are Mexicans allowed  There’s no titties at Todd’s house  Wes trying to get a pic  My house allows a wide assortment of drugs. We also have very lenient human rights laws  And large 🍺 Hangover burger is the shit Mmmm I like twin Peaks because the food there is delicious  I'm down for a house. Hell yeah flex bro The sacrificial lamb  We also need to draft somewhere that has good service so I can check shit on my phone  Let’s do whatever @Todd Wiencek wants, that way, if it sucks, we can vote him out 😂😂 I thought thats what we were supposed to do..fuck Exactly Wes will never make a move on dem titties. Just gonna stalk in a creepy way, kinda the way he does on my Facebook  @Wes Young is has the testosterone of a 14 year old girl over here talking about titties...come on son.  Right close to a marker Sooooo twin peaks..cause that's right off 65 Let’s just all meet at an I65 mile marker with a keg  Maybe we could rent chuck cheeses  Homegrown  Wes you host  Wes has the nicest house My man, these look legit Or pleasant view I hate bolt on titties   The problem is it’s either Spring Hill or Ashland City  Much respect  Todd only likes his wife’s boobs I do it with work enough  I’m willing to travel north How are we just now finding out he hates boobs? I ain't driving to spring Hill  Nobody lives close No one lives in the middle  I thought Todd was vetted? I may be out stepping my boundaries with this comment. If so, words can’t express my remorse. Has anyone considered the idea of having it at one of our houses? I personally hate bars. Also, fuuuuuuck y’all  I wasn’t upset about it 😂😂😂 That girl behind the bar was busting out of her bra. It was real nice  This is @Todd Wiencek   Make a comment True  Crowded with titties  You can do it  Todd I really like twin peaks, but it was really crowded.  I bet it was about a strap  Come on Toss  @Todd Wiencek Almost said something  10 days until the draft, and we don't know what we're doing. I had higher expectations....    Who would be first to draft The great battle of 1942  THE LEAGUE OF LOW EXPECTATIONS WOOOOOOOOOOO @Andy Rangel You have my heart. Don’t break it Never forget the great battle of 1918 where this league laid it's foundation The league draft was founded 100 years ago on the corpses of this country  FUCK IT LETS JUST GO TO DAVE AND BUSTERS @Justin Rossano  I was bitching about Dave and Buster's because I was losing twin peaks  @Brian O'Cain You bite your tongue What the fuck why would you say other wise  I only suggested Dolan’s because y’all were bitching Dave and Busters  The league draft is a very big deal sir  Bdubs!  Omg y’all are making this a bigger deal than it is 😂 Twin peaks wooooooooo All in favor for old Chicago? Even his emoji is a tiny bitch 🤦🏽‍♂️ (bitch voice) I really don’t care where we go...just let me know soon so I can verbally cancel our spot at Dolan’s  You’re not gonna get any of that at Dolan’s Commissioner and co-commissioner can veto and overrule How could you say no to this   Twin peaks it is Mandatory league draft change  That’s where I’m gonna be Woooooo let's go to twin peaks   Y'all want to draft at twin peaks still?

Me catching up on the leagues GroupMe  Thinking about his fantasy football season  Woooooooo puff puff pass wooooooooo This is yalls future captain  If Cody were the bum in the scenario he would have used the money for 

a) more cigarettes
b) a new AC
c) worthless junk food 
d) league fees  Boom Plus the original value of merchandise 😎 A $30  I believe the bum bought a pack of Marlboro Reds, a Colt 45, used the change to buy a condom from the gas station bathroom, took a bus to Dickerson road, checked into a motel and got his groove on 🤣 100 https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2017/01/18/how-smart-are-you-the-stolen-money-viral-math-problem-the-correct-answer-explained/ What if the owner stole it from the customer and the customer was just getting his money back from him The real question is, what do you think the bum bought Dude now you’re thinking! And we don't really know when this happened. Inflation could have been pretty drastic between now and then   🤦‍♂️ The correct answer is nobody knows...the $70 worth of merchandise was profit for the owner. For all we know the owner could have inherited the merchandise for nothing and turned around and sold that shit for 70 and profited $70 🤷🏽‍♂️ He actually dropped it without realizing it and then the bum picked it up  If the guy stole the 100 and walked outside and gave it to a bum and then the bum made the 70 dollors purchase. How much did he lose Andy?  I'm excited to see my Justin Bieber haired captain  😔😔 Nah Owner lost $30 cash (real money) and an undisclosed ORIGINAL AMOUNT in merchandise  It's almost fucking here  Are y'all excited for the mother fucking draft Bahahaha  The bigger issue here is Andy runs a business. Think about that. 🤔 Dollors  100 follows was stolen. He lost 100
 I'll cash it for $100 Take that to the bank and cash it 😉 Negative  Answer is A $30  Woooooooo i answered right for the first time in my life..take that fucking high school teachers  If owner purchased stuff for $70 and turns around and sells it for $70 he ain’t making no money 😂😂😂 $100 bitch but it’s not zero so a can never be correct 😑😑😑 The $70 “worth of goods” is retail price. The owner purchased that stuff cheaper and is selling at $70 retail price...so If that’s the case nobody really knows how much money the owner technically lost 🙀 $100 not discounted to zero... as long as they’re still in the store they’re potentially worth $70 @Dylan Pine But the $70 worth of goods was really purchased at a discounted price...how else could the owner make a profit? So the real answer is A) $30 😉 Good point 🧐 but i’m hammered so who knows but now he can’t sell that $70 worth of shit to the next guy... sounds like a hundo to me Question states How much MONEY did the owner lose  I would say A then  Only one  Can't be two answers  I came up with $30 cash and $70 worth of merchandise so I would say A or C  Cool cool no answer  @Andy Rangel $100 C Woooooooo The 2018 Draft will be held at Dolan's Bar & Grill in Cool Springs at 6:00 PM on August 24th.

I did hoe leave me alone  @Andy Rangel @Brian O'Cain @Dylan Pine @Justin Rossano @Nathaniel Collier @Nick Wayne @Paul Miller @Nick Brown @Wes Young @Todd Wiencek @Christopher Lynn Rangel    I also vote Yes to weed  Me too! Oh oh oh  Yes to weed Yes to 6.8 ppr Yes to .5 pt ppr. As far as I know no one has voted against  I vote yes Okay... how about this... either vote on that poll or type out your vote on this chain by the end of the day, or your vote is forfeited... that way we can have an answer for those who want to preplan their picks...  Aahhhhhhh... I’m picking up whacha layin down... While you do get a gain regardless of half or whole point, it seems half point still respects TD value more than whole point.   I love you   Motherfucker looked up the definition 😂😂😂   I like it when you use big words  Either they get a point for a reception or they don't. The value is arbitrary I think  It scales  I don't see a difference between half point and full point  Relying on Cody to explain stuff sounds scary... Cody had to explain to me cause I misunderstood it What’s the reason behind doing .5 pt instead of either keeping the way it is, or doing 1 pt? Click on the black lady, then polls Can you put the link back up here? Vote you mofos  Damnit Alfred 😔 !vote Can you see who all has voted @Christopher Lynn Rangel ? I think .5 PPR is a good move. I totally agree @Paul Miller I want to think about moving to keeper next year too. We just have to keep everyone in the league. #DYNASTY Also, I’d vote for everyone drafting this year with keeper in mind for future... So is the .5 ppr thing happening, or just smoke?    321 is a good method Smoke for at least 2 hours, then wrap 3, 2, 1? No wrap right now  Texas style Bone down to start  I need your guidance wise one  @Justin Rossano pitmaster, bone down or up? Wrap or no wrap  Simple salt and pepper today   'Titans Training Camp' is starting in 2 days 👆 pure gold. 😂😂😂 https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/94mvri/guide_to_not_fucking_up_your_big_money_league/?utm_source=reddit-android Thanks pops.

Gonna have to buy a round of shots at the draft now! WOOOOOOOOOOO! #captainmoney @Todd Wiencek At this moment  @Todd Wiencek Congratulations!  Fucking love it   @Justin Rossano did you order those first 8 patches? 😂😂😂 what the hell?  Gif. Not. Playing. Looking ass... Ohhhjjjjjjjjjhhhhh Not a gif 😱😱 Gif not playing   Go to the meeting and poop yourself. Get to leave early. This should be enough I have a meeting in 10 minutes but I also have diahhrea  Kickers flying off the board. Be able to get Gurley and Bell in the 3rd. #justiceforfuller I'll take that  That's fair  Yes but no points for the TD @Christopher Lynn Rangel  Will fuller for exampleb First round, everyone takes a kicker Can punt returns get points for every yard  So the strategy is you want a really bad one.  This league has exceeded my expectations  40 yarder = 24 points How about we make kickers negative points for each field goal they make  I think we should give kickers .5 points for every yard of the kick plus their points.  Dats my boi Nooooooooo I vote we keep kicker!  😂 whoopsie mvn clean install && mvn package need to make it yeti racist lol Dylan Pine is a known racist. !dylan I wasn't offering, just showing mine off closer I got that yeti coffee cup  or maybe that cool waterproof backpack so i can wear it to the draft  looking at the new 70qt tundra imma need more than a sticker bro @Dylan Pine  if you vote to eliminate kickers I will give you one Yeti sticker Do for the vine  Come. On yeti Gosh dammit I love it I vote no more kickers. Wes is very persuasive  I'll buy you a 3 month sub to premiumasian.com I'm sensing collusion @Nick Wayne  Mmmmmm.  Well, the voice of reason is clearly biased and no longer reasonable. I’m voting opposite of whatever Christopher says.  One QB, two RBs two WRS, two Flex spots and defense  @Nick Wayne  can we get a voice of reason on Kickers? Yea kuck kickers  KUCK FICKERS I want to go down in history as the greatest league of low expectations  FUCK KICKERS The Fantasy Footballers did it too My bad. I forgot we switched to fan duel  Let's be apart of the next great move  Fan duel did  So we are going half. Point ppr but won't talk about kickers We can get rid of the kickers when the NFL does He knows me so well Remove kicker  Let's talk about it @Justin Rossano  #civilwar @Justin Rossano  would vote no. If we could vote on it, I'd vote yes So real talk @Justin Rossano @Wes Young ..are we getting rid on kickers  😂😂😂  Mmmmm I might try it  yeah 🤔Does it have gifs built in Gboard  What keyboard are you using   I always hit the period when doing the space bar  Meant on.

Hmmmmmmm Let’s get hammered drunk... and go to a Montley crew concert! Naw man for half point PPR... We drinking tonight? For what there chalky white? @Paul Miller you ready baby? WOOOOOOOOO! Hello suckas Interesting... @Andy Rangel he has averaged 62 per season over the course of 5 seasons. @Nick Wayne What happened to Asian Thursday’s?  Woooooooo Fortnite is live #ballhog @Cody Alexander you ever find them receptions per game for Leveon Bell? 🤢🤢🤢 😂😂😂 It's Brandon Freeman and Keven Don't tell me it's Dan  😂 He has to watch all 10 episodes of band if brothers Wow WOW Keven is making dinner so I doubt he'll be on  And Keven Mark and June  It's Keveeeeeen. 2 live crew  I am the crew  I'm. Not on so. Who are you playing with  🤦🏽‍♂️ I'm playing fortnite with my crew  I can't get on @Cody Alexander I’m only getting on if Paul and Todd are on  🤤 Mmmmm @Justin Rossano  spicy garlic is the shit  Ready for football! Woooooooooooooo Soooooo Google Hangout at 8? Yes I need to buy the correct and most accurate magazine  @Andy Rangel need to know because it's a different magazine for PPR... When are we going to have an official “unofficial” FaceTime league meeting regarding these new changes? @Justin Rossano @Wes Young   🤣🤣🤣 😂😂😂 🐢 !chris  We’re talking about Chris  Wes nobody cares  But the X is dumb as shit  If they come out with a better option than the iPhone x I may switch back over  I fixed my notifications I. Wish. I. Had. A. IPhone. Again.  Ahhh the good. Ole iPhone days.  Y’all remember when chris thought bench points mattered  And you aren't remembering correctly Chris. It was that day - I got that shit changes in minutes.  😂😂😂 Remember when @Christopher Lynn Rangel could type a sentence without random periods in the middle of them? Nah I got fucked as well It was just me and Chris who suffered over the vetoes.  😂 Remember when I got points for. The return on the titans and then yanked away the next day  😁😁😁 Y'all remember the first few weeks of our first season when no trades made it through because of vetos  Probably looking up ways to. Cause collusion  @Nick Wayne where the hell you at? You Asian women loving bastard  😂😂 Correct Was it nick Wayne  Who said that the first year cody No one can prove that... Cody and Chris are colluding... Bitch voicd 😂😂😂 He thinks we need his vote.  Who was the mother fucker that said that the first year Collusion!!!!  Collusion  Cost me a championship  No vote from me No punt return points I was 11th. @Brian O'Cain 😂 Last place always wants change the next year Fucking loser Bitch ass is just mad that it didn't happen to his player  Fuck Cody  I don't make it to the playoffs so I don't think Andy has a good point  I'll hook you up baby Cody isn't a commissioner There will be no punt return points... Dem garbage time points thoooooo I'm. Okay with that  If you agree to eliminate defense and kickers I'll make the change  If we are changing everything then I want change for punt returns  Maybe  Will will fuller get punt return points  Because I want to lose in the first round of the playoffs because my opponent got a -1yard reception in garbage time   Wes why do you want half point PPR?  I have a prescription. It's for my glaucoma Oh, OK. Regarding the football talk. I am good  Soon though Not yet  Nah What are you not high right now?  I need a detailed counter argument Why Brian?   So dumb  I am out  Half point PPR is a good move for the league.  But give me 20 minutes until the kids go to bed  I'm completely sober Put the weed down Wesley 🤣 Or we could get rid of kickers and defense for the betterment of the league 🤔 Also nerfing kickers is a good change  Half point PPR is moving the league in the right direction for the future. It’s a good change. We’ve been very good at making changes to better the league. This is one of those changes. I’m happily undecided  👌 just wait until y'all see the draft board this year  HALF POINT PPR GET HYPE  Make it. Better for the wr and rbs Wooooo Half point PPR WOOOOOO! I'm all in for the half ppr I embrace change what you mean cuz I'm all for .5 ppr Chris hates change  Non ppr league what 🙋🏽‍♂️ All in favor for most kicker points 👀 Sleeper  @Todd Wiencek what's your email for the league? I gotcha buddy I want cake.... The fact that you continue to be surprised after seeing my family picture is astonishing  It's just you continue to surprise me @Wes Young Always be creepin on my social media. We all know I’m super white. No need to repeat yourself. Bout to pick up his birthday cake  @Justin Rossano  now if this ain't some of the whitest shit ever.  Ohhhhh shit Dez. First round woooooooo     Nope. Not taking it back.  You take that shit back  Then we would have to wait longer for football  You shut the fuck up dammit I wish they would get rid of the preseason. Don't need that shit  Is that Aaron Murray  Idk who that is Get to see Lamar Jackson Shitty teams but I love football  Football Woooooooooooo Bears and ravens  Everybody  Who playing tonight? @Christopher Lynn Rangel   @Wes Young  https://www.facebook.com/100012233953833/posts/545751865842607/  Woooo Football dammit Football.

I’m assuming a $5 handy won’t be have a lot of effort put into it, but that’s still an absolute bargain  We are lining up short people in the front tall people in the back  😂 LINE STARTS HERE GODDAMNIT! Gotta get in line Those run $450  Todd is prepaying for a handjob No that's like a review score.  All of them $wyyup and you don't actually owe any money right now  Is that 10 out of 10 handys u would prefer them from Wes?  Asking for a friend Didn't use my link  Dammit... White power wins again  The Snuggle bear feels like sandpaper by comparison... Who do I pay? And how much? True story... Only reason Cody came to my birthday party.. Hoping Wes would get drunk and give him a handy 10/10 would let Wes give me a handy. I moisturize with regular masturbation They're computer hands   According to @Cody Alexander he’s got the softest hands known to man    "this will not impact your performance review in any way" - @Nick Brown  Like Seth Rogen  So. Cuddly and loveable  😔 I'm no match for Wes  Todd it’s easy just click on the link of whoever you like best  😂 except I never posted a link @Nick Brown Pulling the Chief card I'll let you keep my strap that you gave back to me but Cody lost  We will see who Todd likes more I'll give you a handy  I also sent my link  Todd u should probably click on my link Look it up What is it  😍😍😍 Chris let's buy no man's sky  Got it Click my link @Todd Wiencek  I just text you the link  Ya know since I'm poor  Not his  Or my name  Sign up using my name so we each get $5 Is somebody getting a kickback from this damn app?

Is the app actuary named Cash App?  @Wes Young's soft ass hands can do some amazing things. Pretty cool stuff. And he did this in like 3 hours. So this is basically a funny test he said. This is part one - making the bot talk to Group Me and respond. Part two is using the ESPN api to make it pull data for updates for us.  He is brilliant.

I'll dig into the espn api later this week. I'm a decent programmer but I'm not that good. Have no idea why it did the link You should make it write game narratives like NFL.com does after games.  but that will be later. I've worked out how to make the bot tag names, just have to build it. I figured, � No one is. Like no one. If anyone is remotely interested in looking at the code, it's here: https://github.com/WesYoung91/FF_Bot/tree/master/src/main/java/com/ffbot/container � No, FUCK YOU Wes Young! fuck you bot I'm done working on the bot today since I basically didn't do any of my real work. But the bot will eventually be hooked up to ESPN's api so it can throw some usefull/useless information into the chat once the season starts. 🤣🤣🤣 DADDY!!! !paul DADDY!!!! !wes Muhhhhh strap  😂😂😂 Strap thief! !todd Brian refuses to embrace technology. !Brian  yeah he doesn't do that right now...

Nope. I am not downloading that sketchy app  also, benefit of using Cash App is that the moment the season closes, we can pay winnings through the app so we don't have to physically hand over money. @Dylan Pine  I told you that you could pick it up whenever you wanted. No one ever did. He said it  😱😱😱 so like december prob ill pay just as promptly as i got paid my winnings... 🙄🙄🙄 I finished 2nd in something finally!

What’s the date And @Andy Rangel is looking into a place called Dolan's in Franklin that his friend manages
 We can get a private room at a place called Stout's in Brentwood and draft there . Anyone have any draft location suggestions? Justin got the info for Dave and Buster's and it'll be about $36.50 per person including everyone pitching in for the board bitch, paying for an extra hour in the private room for a total of 4 hours, 3 food platters, and 2 alcoholic drinks per person.

I was looking at others the other day  So I switched to pulse Wow I was using Android messaging til Wes said it sucked It's the best  Mmmm Android messaging What do u use  🤔 Android messaging /allo @Brian O'Cain that members mark stuff is really nice   But i  am just a peasant  I still support members mark  I for one will only be supporting Ozark trail from now on What messaging app do you use It's doing amazing sir Wow I had no idea yeti hated the second amendment @Christopher Lynn Rangel how is that s9 doing?   https://media1.giphy.com/media/EDt1m8p5hqXG8/giphy.gif?cid=a058f94b5ade6fa74a33514d67f80f65 Tweet it   all this yeti shit is fake news All this talk about yeti and then this happens. Coincidence, I don't think so. Illuminati confirmed  That kid looked exactly like DJ Khaled 😂😂😂 I’m about to get that Styrofoam 70 though!!!! wow, I just saw that snap of you harassing some kid at the park calling him dj khaled. I loved that cooler...just too damn heavy and too big 😕 😂 I haven't loaded your snaps since the titans uniform reveal I just looked. 🤦🏽‍♂️ you snap way too much I just dismiss your notifications lol yes but I never look at it Do you still have Snapchat wesly? https://media1.giphy.com/media/IcLQfLt0L4g92/200.gif you get the full $58? SOLD MY COOLER DOEEEEEE  https://media2.giphy.com/media/vkwAeqMEUSaoU/giphy.gif?cid=a058f94b5adddf2a70647345675003e0 Oh my lord. @Dylan Pine Needs to be on suicide watch Sorry @Dylan Pine  😂😂  I'm dying...so easily amused. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Bitches ain’t cheap 😂  He about to shoot  That one in the white is angry 😳 😂😂😂  What the hell is wrong with you? 😂  😳😂😂 I’m having too much fun with Legos 😂 🤷🏽‍♂️ 2 for weekends. gotta have a change when you get shitfaced  1 for ever week day  😂😂 He's already ordered one... The fact that there is a little me is fucking terrifying... you know it... my ass is a little worried you better believe it @Dylan Pine about to pay so hard for all those years he's been raising hell... But splitting a season package is a pretty good deal still. Preds have 40 home games. The games you don’t go to, you can sell. Plus you have first access to playoff tickets  I used to go to 8-10 games a year And single game seats will probably be that much next year, because they are sold out on season tickets next year Crazy. Never would've guessed. Usually it’s around that They are pretty expensive man.  On a serious note @Justin Rossano - are the Antioch tickets really 80 fucking dollars? That’s a fantastic analogy  Hahahaha In the Antioch section The lower bowl is like Davidson/Williamson county. You want tickets in the Lawrence, Giles, Hickman county sections. Not the assholes that pay to sit down low and sit the entire game, don’t chant, and all that bullshit I’ve wanted them for a couple seasons, somewhere up high where the “real fans” sit Yeah, unfortunately it’s the “cool thing in town” now and they are outrageously expensive  I sit next to two people at work thst have season tickets  I want to get season tickets, but need 1 to 2 other people to split them with I remember when you could get them sumbitch for nothing. Back when no one gave a fuck. I only went to one game this season because of that I'm not that committed yet  I'm out  Nah $80 What are cheap regular season Preds tickets now Justin?  I wanna order an Arvi one I think they're a bit warmer because the sleeves are long  The new adidas ones are nice. I found a site that has them cheaper than in the pro shop I really want a jersey. They are just generally cooler than football jerseys I think. On the real - off-season league activity next year! I did. I’ve been to at least 20 games. But now that they are good, ticket prices are outrageous  You gave me your blessing @Justin Rossano  😳 I've only been to one.  Yeah, I would say bandwagon, but you were super late to the party And also that I've been to more than three games  Me and Wes anguished over whether or not it was a bandwagon move. Determined it wasn't by virtue of hometown team. I'm a hardcore t-shirt fan  I also did not own on until last year  Considering your ass didn’t own a Preds shirt until last year’s playoff run, I figured it was worth explaining  Yes I get it. Thank you Dr. Hockey... Best sport live It's really exciting I don't know why I never watch hockey in regular season.  Power up/Back to full strength  Yeah, that’s an Avalanche thing  Yeah that's cool Pretty cool... Did anyone else just hear the Mario power up sound when the powerplay ended? 😂😂😂 No doubt. That pic is going to be memed this entire upcoming season I love that picture... Man tons better Oh yeah way fucking better look at that I have a pro and like to pretend I can notice a difference but not really.    WOOOOOOOOO...I'm hype.    Gotta finish lost in space first  Westworld is one of the best I'll get around to it eventually   and you loved the ones youve watched. I've suggested tons of good shows to you why you no like good tv Woooooooo Hyped Get hype Wooooooo workout time y'all hyped about that westworld season 2 premier?

They gonna give me $45 fuck that  Dem pawn shops thooooooo  Go pawn that thing. There are like 45 pawn shops within a mile radius of you because Antioch You about as smart as a pelican “I got that hot PELICAN”  True story  😂😂😂 Everyone sees the location as Antioch and assumes that cooler is stolen as fuck. Them fucking RTICs were sold out   Your dumb ass just bought it last year when you didn’t wanna wait for an RTIC He's had it on Facebook for weeks 😂😂😂 I got it for sale on the low low  no  i Anyone want to buy a Pelican 70? 👀 Sitting on his yeti bucket  no peasant shit for me While sitting in his yeti truck  i got my yeti belt and my yeti hat on drinking beer in my yeti colster out of my yeti cooler We would also have to make it all something other than Verizon. remember when we were gonna make this league iphone only so we an actually group text? we should do that again Dylan is just now calming down from someone dissing YETI earlier    Nah brick attack Nick plays the shit out of some snake.

NFL fantasy Best one out there Duh 😍😍😭 Yesssssssssss Are we going to go with CBS this year?   Cody is at work and bored as fuck, so he goes balls deep in the fantasy world 🤔 We all know... We all know Wes is a lame duck... $10 a pop  He likes to think so. I think he doesn’t have a life other than fantasy football, so he just tried to take mine and @Wes Young job  Ask Justin then... And end up going all the way Is Cody the Comish? @Justin Rossano  
Asking for a friend.  So we won’t be drafting a RB while he is getting hurt on live tv  Best dates for the drafts look like August 31st (B), September 1st (C) or the 2nd (A). That's a Friday, Saturday, or a Sunday. That's after the preseason is over. If Todd comes aboard, we have 2 from every shift for the time being at least.  I would like the tailgate option added to party at someone house  About $240 Standby How much 💰 is left for draft day? Season opener is September 6th. Don't know yet. Need to get some options together though. When is draft day? I’m can’t commit   Game is on September 16th, which is a C shift, @ noon. Titans v. Texans. Created new poll 'Titans home opener options. Would you rather?': https://s.groupme.com/4ANcyHgo Andy and I discussed the Titans home opener a moment ago - neither of us expected the tickets to go on sale this soon as they went on sale later last summer. As of last night there were still tickets available but we were talking about other options for that day also.   Holy fuck I got like 300 messages I have a lot of reading to catch up on 😂 My fantasy luck     I have a yeti 😯😳😯😍😍😍😍  See you soon boo 😘 I just wanted to see it. I've turned it off.   Dinner and a movie   You ready for our bro date Don’t be playing yet hoe wait for me Don’t lie to me dammit Wooo @Christopher Lynn Rangel this looks better than horizon I’m seriously debating switching so he s9+ @Dylan Pine's blood pressure has just skyrocketed About the phone. Your asking a guy who buys a Sam's cooler instead of yeti. And no, I am not buying that dumb overpriced yeti bucket....  Gosh dammit love it when you do that Mmmm talk dirty to me All a man needs in life  Ps4 pro and a badass vizio M series  Accurate  Dammit Wesley That TV is the only modern thing in that room  😱😱😱 Not my fault Kirk doesn't want to send people to rope tech...I'm fine with my OPS... 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 League Champion U know what else Cody isn’t? Cody isn’t Todd’s a rope Tech    Damn - he got me. Gotta go  😂😂 I would bet my house that it wouldn’t happen But you the same height now so What were you saying Cody  When we were kids I weighed 65 lbs I'll bodyslam Chris like I did when we were kids...no problem... The S9 is about $1000 so I wouldn't get to carried away on the price difference. But they are really good at marketing. There is that......  https://v.groupme.com/32336378/2018-04-20T20:21:54Z/322bd590.480x272r90.mp4 I don’t. Take advice from someone who can’t pull himself up But you have that captain money I really just don't like how proprietary apple is. And everything Apple is over priced in my opinion.  Chris gonna bodyslam your ass Shit...you were the first loser. I’m defending league champion I told the little bitch I liked it and he cried about his iPhone... Especially for fantasy football advice  So there is that He use to drive a Prius HahahahahahahHahah  He isn’t very reliable Cody made the switch, he could probably let you know ow if it was worth it  I’m about tired of apple  They both would be comparable to the iPhone x, but I prefer Android.  S9 supposed to have been camera out right now  Definitely titties And titties I like to take pics of flowers I like the s9 because it's got some of the good features from the note series. Both have really good cameras  Pixel had some hardware issues at launch  More so about the camera I have heard about the pixel 2 The 2 I am looking at are the pixel 2 or the s9+ Is the s9+ good? Sky walker Note 5 See stupid phone Teach me skywalksr What phone do you have 😭😭 That's really it  First and foremost, it's not a apple product.  A hahaha.

I’m dead  I'm also physically sick after typing that Andy has a better option  Just keeping options open  Now Wesley, this is for the good of the league. It’s not for certain, but he seems like a good dude. @Justin Rossano  if this "backup" is named Guy Powell, You're going to need a second backup as well. He will give you a raise... Just talked to Cody. We have a backup in case Mason is out this year 😂😂😱 When my boss asks why I haven't finished my project yet, I'll show him this.   He fishes @Nick Brown  I need to know of any other hobbies that I can continue to add into this picture 😂ha!!!!

I’m out on the falcon I think 🤔  Yes I remember him too  😯😯😯 I will confirm with @Brian O'Cain That was definitely the guy sitting behind us and to our right at the game  Are you serious Brian? You remember that guy? So who's going to mortgage their house to pay for this guy's tab to be our board bitch? 🤣🤣🤣 That is the same guy who yelled the whole game with his shirt off. I really think that is him.....  This is an idea worth pursuing... He struck me somewhere between bud heavy and Natty ice... maybe we can just bring a keg to his house and have the draft party there. he looks like a bud heavy kinda guy We can't have him be the board bitch... His tab would put us all in debt... we should have him at our draft party I want to party with him  That guy can probably out drink all of us combined at a tailgate... https://instagram.com/p/BhaMg2EjQZC/ Yeah, that part sucks.

Here you go Justin  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B5YNiCfWC3A  king kunta 👌🏻👌🏻 JEEZY! Or just listen to the Jeezy discography and be happy  Then nearly every bit of damn is great  For your Kendrick listening experience, start with good kid maad city, skip most of to pimp a butterfly except a couple of songs.  😂 Wes went momentarily British... It's very much a studio genre  Live* Rap never sounds good love.  I wouldn’t have taken a free ticket to that performance  m.A.A.d city 🔥🔥🔥 I like some of his stuff he’s very deep with his lyrics  So true.  Dude Kendrick is fire tho!  I don’t get the hype about him Mostly everything. Just not Kendrick Lamar @Justin Rossano Out of curiosity what kind of music do you listen to?   Like the jags and bills game  Regardless, this is fucking boring  http://www.theskylineview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3754-1000x1000.jpg 😂 You can go back to scrolling through my Facebook  ....  These teams haven’t played this season Let's watch the same two teams play again.

I’m glad you have my family pic on the ready  Proud of it baby Coming from the whitest family I know  Garbage I’m with ya @Nathaniel Collier  KENDRICK! Them high waters tho! 😂😎 Kendrick is love. Kendrick is life.  Humble!!!  @Cody Alexander , you wanted to watch this tool thats "performing" the half time show?

 This is a very boring game   @Nick Brown  #didtheappliances https://media0.giphy.com/media/FyXtHiMuiWVaw/giphy.gif?cid=a058f94b5a526d6635414347731e439d Finally got to use it the right way woooooooo 🤣🤣🤣  I’m gonna go now  "but even if you don't that's not going to change whats going to happen... “Baby, I may do some unspeakable things tonight. I hope you still love me after.” I would go ahead and tell Nicole beforehand if she were there.  consequences... @Wes Young would have all the same consequesnces is it were Mariota... Jesus Absolutely... Deckers wife count? @Nathaniel Collier would get a restraining order, possibly charged with some sort of sex crime, and have to see a doctor for an erection lasting longer than four hours...  😂😂😂 First? Those are rookie numbers  That would be the moment when Wes gets his first restraining order... @Paul Miller Did run into him Friday afternoon at Teds in Nashville  Sports figures primarily - former Titans or NFL players, maybe a Preds player, actor or actress, sportscaster etc...we would define fame on a case by case basis... I’m gonna get Mariota to come draft for make Wes sit at the other end of the room And everyone has to buy his drinks for the night Not Paul on Wheel of Fortune famous... Define “famous” We need to start a contest to see if we can get a famous person to come be our board bitch...whoever gets someone to come gets to choose where they draft... With a JUICE license plate next We need to write him a letter and see if he will come to our draft nect year... That's what I figured... #billsmafialeader He isn’t allowed to drive anything else In my heart I hope he drives a white bronco... Powerbombs someone through table - catches another murder charge... Hell yeah he does... If the Juice powerbombs somebody through a table, I’m gonna be all in as a Bills fan U know the juice knows how to party OJ!  The caption is so true https://instagram.com/p/BdqB15cDfLf/ 😂😂😂 Wes after the win last night... https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7oqa7m/tifu_by_masturbating_so_hard_my_lung_collapsed/?utm_source=reddit-android God that one was so Savage  Holy shit 🤣🤣🤣 😂 Dude fucked his girl up https://instagram.com/p/BdqBrDjjz8m/ "Personal foul - stabbing. 10 yard penalty. Still first down." - Ref... 10/10 would watch... Bills Mafia vs Raiders fans...aw yeah... I wish the Bills Mafia could field a football team instead of the real Buffalo Bills. #SuperBowl  Very possible  I think there are more bills fans there than jags  They truly are the pride and joy of the NFL fan base  These guys are on a whole different kind of level  https://instagram.com/p/Bdp6-k7jIu3/ For those of you who have forgotten - we are 2 wins away from being in the Super Bowl #TITANUP Yeah...damn I'm torn...I don't want Jacksonville to win shit and Bills going forward would be awesome but I would much rather play the Patriots than the Steelers... I need the Bills Mafia to advance My playoff hopes - Jacksonville beats Bills, Titans beat Patriots, Jacksonville beats Steelers, and then Titans beat the FUCK out of Jacksonville...mmmmmmmmmm...  If you were 0-4 in Superbowls you would have a hatred for random shit too... I don’t know, but there is an extreme hatred towards them, and I’m so glad it exists What do the bills have against tables  That would be amazing  I honestly thought that was @Nick Brown celebrating his championship before I read the comments.  I hope they win and invade Shittsburgh https://instagram.com/p/Bdp2Y5zDwWN/ God yes. In Buffalo I would love to go to a bills tailgate  Bills mafia is lit in Jacksonville right now https://instagram.com/p/Bdp20WIDckc/ #1 in dynasty draft Saw someone said he called all the plays after the 1st quarter  MVP  Channel 4 aired this last night...🤣🤣🤣 😂😂😂 Sorry guys.

Mariota won that game for us...Henry played incredibly and the D was shutdown in the second half... HOLY SHIT MARIOTA THE GOAT  @Andy Rangel is late as fuck on the fantasy answer...yes it counts as 12 points... Concerning fantasy  Mariota pulled that shit off 😂 If a QB throws a pass to himself and scored a TD does he get credited a pass TD and receiving TD??? But it would be nice if the jags lost  I think we'd have an easier time with the pats  If they lose its pats  If they win its Pitt  Unless the bills win Or Pittsburgh  Titans playing patriots next week?  TENNESSEE!!!  Dilly Dilly  HENRY LIKE FUCK BIGGY FUCK CASH MONEY WE THE MOTHER FUCKIN TRUTH If Derrick Henry isn't the feature back next year someone needs to be flogged  Henry from Lischey...

Jimmy G facing down his mentor. Next year, Patriots and SF in the super bowl SF will definitely be a contender next year  Fun fact, Jimmy G has never lost a NFL game How bitches be when Jimmy G walks into the room  https://m.popkey.co/e0597a/oAv9w_s-200x150.gif I feel like they fuck his tempo so much it's like hitting reset every few plays... I'd suck Jimmy G's dick done very well with it but never got to use it. looks so good in it Bad play calling is fucking us...need to run that spread no huddle more...MM looks like a fucking boss in the no huddle... JG handsome AF @Wes Young  Agree with @Andy Rangel  that is... SF winning superbowl next year. Agree...I've heard the foot is also still bothering him... We should trade all of our draft picks to SF to get that suave motherfucker Jimmy G Bad plays calls force MM to fuck up  I blame the coach for MM being so shitty this year  Brady would've thrown 43 TDs to Decker this year... This year? Is MM franchise material? Last year, yes. Decker is white  Decker's hands aren't like they used to be... MM threw some catchable balls Sunday to Decker and that mofo dropped a lot Truth is they can all catch but they’re not super heroes gosh damnit!  Wrong, almost right 🤔, and BYARD BABY!!! THE BEST RECEIVER IS THE ONE WHO MARIOTA THROWS A CATCHABLE BALL TO  The opposing teams secondary? Delanie Whos the best receiver for the Titans? Need to feed Henry and keep Demarco on that bench... 😂 MM been feeding the ball hard to the opposing team They need to feed the ball MORE to COREY DAVIS  pass rush solid. run defense be weak and maybe a solid LB They need to draft a better O line  Thoughts on drafting a QB? shit. but fire Robiskie i don't care keep mularkey. plz bby @Andy Rangel me too!!! I don't think they will get rid of Mularkey now...😣😣😣 https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPmuUNHXSG8mWLC/source.gif Me right now 😎 #multitasking  #Erect Our defense is peaking at the right time... Just need to go ahead and get this loss out of the way so we can get some Josh McDaniels\ Titans should win this week, but I think the road stops there But he’s hot in the playoffs especially at home  I'd rather play buffalo I would rather play the Patriots than the Steelers...Brady been playing like shit lately... Quail Quilt  Quiet?  Quite Titans super fucked 😬 so it's bad either way Then they go to Pitt Exactly  Unless the bills win. 😳 If they win this week, they go to Foxboro A man can only dream  😂 Y'all ready for them Titans to win the Superb Owl? 👋🏽 👃🏽 👀 Best game all season what a game Woooooot woooot Woooooo go dogs  Mmmmmmm Mmmm.

No k. good talk like over the ear headphones.  anyone here have any wireless headphones that they like? 😂  is this for second place @Nick Brown  such a meaningless trophy. well, at least I got a trophy somewhere.

It’s a shame that no other team was able to compete with the STD’s and I had to wreak as much carnage as I did. It has truly been an honor to beat each and every team.
I would like to thank a few people. First of all I have to thank my mother. Without her none of this would not even be possible. Second of all I would like to thank Cody. I had a feeling that all of his wins previously have been purely luck, so as he would give me advice I would just do the exact opposite and it has really propelled my team to the top and his straight to the bottom!! Anyways here is a short video clip that I want to leave you all with. Well, it’s part of that whole “Cody is a bitch” thing and just another reason to vote him out of the league  i didn’t know waiting til the season was over was an option  Lmao! The co-commish is holding the money, and currently waiting on @Cody Alexander to pay up  @Justin Rossano hey commish if you want to drop off my winnings today at st 2 i’ll be in your bed No anyone get anything interesting for christmas?

I'm only dropping Kelce...I feel like Ebron is better... *1 million FAAB playoff bonus only applies to league commissioners. Some restrictions may apply I’m in I'm in oh man Last 4 teams in the playoffs get 1 million FAAB dollars to use for the remainder of the season Wes gonna go in and hit everyone up with a service tax. 😂  Imma about to log in and edit mine up to 1000 I'm faab poor Currently thinking about all of the ways to spend my money  Yes. Heavy collusion with $1 Says person who only has a dollar in FAAB...#COLLUSION oooooooOOOOOooOOooOooOOoOoooOOoo I hope that teams vacating their roster have a new league to go to next year 😂 that way your only player will be broken. Just like your playoff run. Andy just keep wentz  @Nick Brown that's how I read it So u “could” drop everybody except 1 and still be OK 👌  I'm not dropping everyone - I'm keeping David Johnson... BUT, if someone would like to drop me a couple gems, that would be allowed Just to be clear, you are NOT to drop your entire roster if you have lost. This is something that we can entertain for next year, but it would skew the remaining playoffs.   😂😂😂  I’m seriously bout to drop my whole team tomorrow morning 😏 Lemme get Drake  It shined like a mother fucker!!! You put up killer numbers 😳 A sun shines on a dogs ass every now and again.

I accidentally forgot that Stewart was gonna have 28 points. Can you swap him out for Demarco? Y’all keep changing shit!  😂  like absorbing the energy from your defeated foes no, but that is a really cool idea for a league.  So in the playoffs whoever wins gets to pick 1 player from the other team? Right? @Brian O'Cain Can I please get Landry back. Can't believe fucking Andy got him for free Drake is a monster Collusion  Damn @Justin Rossano is lucky he has a bye week https://media1.giphy.com/media/CsA9ldJhWDHCo/giphy.gif?cid=a058f94b5a2f48683745627a551a86c4 Mmmm Tom Brady looking real good👌 https://www.facebook.com/EaglesEra/videos/1986443688265600/ I'm out of the playoffs but it is still fucking Asian Monday.

Still doing research. The “well I started off  0-4” is throwing everything off We're really going to have to up the league fees next year  $2800 on Craigslist.  @Nick Brown Made the playoffs this year...  Yea @Brian O'Cain the first year is alway the toughest. Should have listened to @Cody Alexander more. Oh wait.......... This pretty much sums up my season 😂😂😂 Short  Yesssss!  Shot bus Asian Mondays! Waka going hard on top @Nick Wayne Can host Asian mondays from the short bus Those were good days...playoffs was whites only...the right people were in the championship... https://media1.giphy.com/media/BBERVNIZBI1pu/giphy.gif?cid=a058f94b5a272ea777646867552fe260 Definitely short I’m pricing out purchasing a party bus.

But how did you spend your winnings? I suck I made playoffs in both of my  leagues this year  But this year is looking alright.  Thanks man I wasn’t gonna bring it up @Wes Young  And promptly lost two in a roe  I made playoffs last year.  Paul has been mediocre for the last 2 years 😂 It’s the first year struggle. I missed the playoffs last year and now...regular season champ I almost sat A. Smith. He showed out with 45 points and then the rest of the team thought they were on a bye week  I appreciate your continued contribution to the league.  Sorry cap I lost another one. I am really getting good at this losing thing....  😂😂😂 this gif is killing me  😂😂 oh shit Created new poll 'Should Mason come back to the league?': https://s.groupme.com/9V7QTyph also, there is DMX singing rudolf the reindeer on spotify.

I may go pick up the entire Browns roster for this week @Justin Rossano  who should I start next week? Gave him the juju Gave I have him Hopkins and turned his weeks around Kamara going first round next year.

Chris
2. Nate
3. Paul
4. Cody
5. O’Cain 
6. Mason I bet cbs has a way to do this. Way to go@Chris Rangel  for picking ESPN. Yeah, I’m not seeing a way to manually adjust it. In that case, we rank them 1-6. 1 plays 6, 2 plays 5, and 3 plays 4 Or a “super” sticker? Ugh, fucking ESPN  Does the winner get a participation ribbon?  I don't see a way to give them a bye week.  The consolation bracket should be set as the following:
Chris and Paul get bye weeks due to the records in their respective divisions. Nate plays O’Cain and Cody plays Mason. The winner of Nate/O’Cain plays Chris, and the winner of Cody/Mason plays Paul Got knocked the fuck out 😂 not that it matters though. Trying to figure out how to set the consolation bracket... Playoff bracket is set.

Bryanna yelled "you're so ghetto" to the woman from GE customer service - this occured yesterday... Can we throw Andy overboard? I'm gonna bond so hard with y'all  Shit is gonna go down  I think a cruise would solidify our bond as a league.  https://media.giphy.com/media/dRGWII2nDN1D2/giphy.gif So embarrassing  They will talk bad to the help...

WOOOOOOOOOOOOO Their powers combined  Let's do the cruise this year...let's go... Bryanna too I’ve heard June gets shit done Wes get June to speak to the manager  Call them up "yes id like the commissioners suite please"  As long as our rooms are all together, I don’t give a shit 😬 Overruled  Quiet down.

Nicole already is on board  Cody - “ bitches fuck” Yea. She would prolly be down There's no way my wife would let me escape a weekend without the kids without taking her too.  😂  She would survive  Nah, Crystal could sit in the casino For sure divorce  Bring the bitches  Let's fucking draft next week. Too hype  Oh, that could be worse  The idea is to bring spouses with us @Nick Brown With that captains money and no kids....he is buying all the alcohol  @Nick Brown i think the idea is to take spouses  😂🤦🏽‍♂️ The last time I went on a “guys” cruise someone almost got divorced.  😂 ON THE BUCK! CODY ON THE BUCK  We can find some chick on the boat to be our board bitch General Jackson? @Andy Rangel  Andy wants to take a cruise on a pontoon down the Cumberland  $300/person And the Andrew Jackson 👀 3 or 4 day is pretty damn cheap For a three day  Which is another reason why I said to get another year under our belts before switching  250ish a person I think Agreed. Next year would be out for me too What are the prices???  Probably out on destination draft next year but the following I'm all in.  I have looked at both options pretty heavily. A cruise would be much cheaper  � Pick either one.  Seriously though we need to start thinking about next years draft...I’m down for a cruise tho or VEGAS 👀 This is true Wes would rather give you his child It would be fair No Wes needs to give me that bye Just let it happen buddy 😂😂😂 I hate to bring up old business but Wes admitted that having two commissioners with bye weeks was shady.  Cody be like “ so y’all down to fuck” 😂😂😂😭😭😭 #yalldowntofuck  #swingers #cody Everyone has to gang up on cody  And pillow fighting  Go big or
Go home Adult sleep over YAAAAAAAY  No, cruise is the way to do it man Big cookout. Smoked meats. Copious amounts of beer.  Or house party/sleep over 💁🏽‍♂️ 😍😍😍 If we go dynasty, we are drafting from a cruise ship!! glad i put rodgers on IR... Lemme get Michael vick 👀 I'm in if I get David Johnson.  Drafting Greg zurlein first round  Imma be fuckin hammered  I feel like I need to physically go to Games and scout players 😂😂😂 30 rounds Long term commitment. 
Kinda like David Johnson  Thinking about the first draft for the dynasty makes my dick hard.  I think it will be less overall work in a sense... I drafted a very marginal team.  i feel like i would need a fucking secretary to be in a dynasty league lol We’re going to re-draft next year THEN START DYNASTY  A dynasty works very much like an NFL team does @Nick Wayne  We would draft a dynasty team... I think that we need one more year under our belt as a league before switching  We'd start fresh nick Can we make trades before we lock in the dynasty? But I'm completely in  I really love the idea of a dynasty but it's more of a commitment and a long term type of thing.  Out some salsa on it I mean Paul I'm confused like Taco.  Lol Yes it is After this year yes Next year yes 😏 I like the idea of doing one.  Unless everyone wants it to be.  Hell to the mother fucking no No So this is a dynasty league now? 👋🏽 I can't wait to lose my first game of the playoffs like last year. Sweeeeeet I'll let you touch it. I want to take pics with it too sure Can I borrow the trophy when you win m o i s t moist I don't want to but that's because my team makes me moist. Of course we'd redraft buddy that way I have AB, Evans, Baldwin, McCoy & Gordon I’m out this year nah After we re draft..yes so you're in for dynasty?  @Chris Rangel ?

This sounds like consolation bracket bitterness to me Y’all = shady bitches making up rules like... read the constitution... 🙄🙄🙄 Precisely @Cody Alexander  Paul = Taco...

Clearly this isn't accurate.  🤤 Mmmmmmmm Brady https://media3.giphy.com/media/rOJvPDsG3StAk/giphy.gif And his ungrouted floors  Poor thing has had to see Cody's balls... 
 But i want that trophy  You are a cold mother fucker Then to lose to Dylan 😂😂😂 It would almost be nice to kero his hopes up for one more week.  They are exclusive in this scenario. But if you were to pull off both.... Are you they mutually exclusive?  What option for A and B Wes, I am very curious about what would be more satisfying:

A. You eliminating Cody from the playoffs this week

B. You win the league championship

C. Winning the lottery. (This is not likely, but is good for comparison to options A and B)    x404 x803   Can we trade a playoff spot I don't really need to trade. I just wanted to belong.  Nicks interested too I can't offer you nick.  Nawl, that ain’t an offer. Come hard in the paint!! Nick?? What do you need  Wes, what you offering? FYI, today is the 5 year anniversary of the Butt Fumble Such a hot commodity... Cody, quit acting like you’ve had him all season and nobody wanted him! Closer... Tom Brady, Carlos Hyde and the rest of my FAAB budget??? #traderape Nah - don't try to rob me... I know it doesn't seem quite fair, but would you consider Antonio Brown? Doesn’t everyone??? yeah Want David Johnson? Even@Cody Alexander  hasn't tried to offer  me a shitty trade. I know. What's going on? Everyone is scared to shake it up man Woooo trades.  I will take him back  Who wants AB?  HAPPY FRIDAY  Let's make some questionable moves  Come at me with them trades  WOOOOOOOOOOOIOOOOII Trade deadline is tonight! Make dem moves  @Paul Miller  I could probably middle man negotiate a trade for david johnson if you'd be interested. I do. Who wants em? What’s Fournette worth fellas? David Johnson? Who’s got a good rb to give up? Hummer limo 😎 https://instagram.com/p/BbxXsnWD9gw/ #thatsmyQB #hesgotbigballs #shesgotbigballs 😂😂 I still think it is a good investment but just be careful.  https://www.howmuchisit.org/falcon-bird-cost/ I did some research and it could be as much as $100,000 for a genetically engineered falcon.  Nick.  @Paul Miller Don't you do it. This week😬😬😬 https://media1.giphy.com/media/IzELwDFOUFCUw/giphy.gif 😂 just deducted 20 points No dumbass it’s Tuesday 🙄 Is it Thursday yet?  Cost is not an issue for other other Nick any more. He's living in that survivor pool tax bracket.  Get the falcon man! I'm not sure how much a falcon costs but I'm sure you could always seduce/capture a pigeon   https://media1.giphy.com/media/WFIkZlfyFLyCI/giphy.gif That seems like both a logical and reasonable use of the money.  Maybe a falcon? @Nick Brown what are you going to do with your newfound wealth? 😂 https://media3.giphy.com/media/xTiN0AzIip3qG7GQ5q/giphy.gif 🙎🏿‍♂️🙋🏼‍♀️🌘🤰🏼👶🏿👶🏿🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏿‍♂️ 🌖

Cody check your proposals 👁👃🏽👁 I'm not a smart man.  But you didn’t want him 🤦🏽‍♂️ Dammit Asian I tried to offer you SANU Thomson just sprained his ankle nothing serious  I need Sanu back.😂😂😂 LETS FUCKING DO THIS 🤔 Thompson for Johnson  I sent him someone with 3 times as many TDs as Julio... Cody let’s trade 😎 😂😂😂 In order to WIN I have to trade Chris Thompson! Shameful... He ain't trying to trade... 😭😭😭 Don't feel bad Andy - he rejected my offer too...😓 😂 https://media0.giphy.com/media/S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o/giphy.gif “Trade Chris Thompson to WIN” 😂😂😂 I'm leaning on accepting.  I like you Andy. League vote? Asian nick check your team roster  Fucking Julio 🤤 Just submit trade requests. First come first served.   Yes Cody. I will trade you Julio for anyone on your team.  Asian nick I’ll give you Chris Thompson for Julio 👀 I’ll trade you  Also David Johnson... Again! Quick update. Julio is up for sale.  Me after spending that SURVIVAL POOL money!!  @Justin Rossano  I think this was from 2008 or so. Last time Julio caught a TD pass.  https://media1.giphy.com/media/uitsdSx5v8E0g/giphy.gif JULIO!!!  Caught a pass.  With all these redzone targets for Graham, he might score 30 points  Special teams balling out Damn.  Cody got tackled like that when he tried out for football 😂😂😂 Dayyyyyyyyyymmmmmmnnnnnnn!   Very lit Quite Jimmy graham just got lit up.  They r a second half team Seattle getting that ass whooped  https://media3.giphy.com/media/hVYVYZZBgF50k/giphy.gif I still like Asians  I still like you as a person.

Yes Those adjustments should have made it where I clinch the division now... right??? Better than what it took from Andy  Wes. Your scoring adjustments took 7 points from my team. I'm freaking out. 👎 😂😂😂 oh, and you're now 0-10 Andy 👍🏼 I did the math, that is correct. Andy bitched in 8 weeks this season. 

8 weeks x 100 points/week =800 points https://media1.giphy.com/media/KayVJ5lkB84rm/giphy.gif I also deducted 800 points from @Andy Rangel  so no one freaks out, I went through and updated the scores for weeks 1 & 2 to match what was scored on cbs before we switched leagues.   🤣🤣🤣 Yes just like my mom goes down 😳 That’s good shit right there! @Justin Rossano bye week bros Like your mom goes down??  Naw Justin you going down 😈 I need to win the next 2 to get the bye as well.  mmmm It would Just be so much sweeter to beat that ass currently 1186.1	 to 918.5 you have to win at least one I NEED THAT BYE WEEK correct I just can’t lose the next two you have him beat by a ridiculous amount of total points.  not really, you could lose to him since you already beat him once and still win the tie breaker.  This week’s game between Andy and I has all the marbles on it. Heavy bye week implications  BTW. It's Asian Monday!!!!! https://media1.giphy.com/media/7o8VVj6IIpKs8/giphy.gif Or maybe get Justin to lose a few games? Can we share it Wes?   @Nick Wayne needs to stop going after my bye week.  Rules are rules 🤷🏽‍♂️ that's my co-commissioner.  😭😭😭 The way ESPN scored it is correct. Points are correct. Andy, quit whining 😂 yep Based on yahoo answers 😂😂😂 I might be fucked on those 2 points 😩 I’ve been reading about it...says if it’s behind line of scrimmage (pass) and player gets TD it would be a rushing TD. Because if they didn’t catch lateral it would be considered a fumble 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️😱 Call ESPN if you have any issues they’re very helpful 🤤 The lady I talked to at ESPN said she understands my frustration 😂😂😂  Fuck you!!! They said it would be a stat correction Fuck you little bitch I just called ESPN and it’s going to be taken care of so fuck off and I hope you lose by exactly 1.9.  @Andy Rangel I even went and checked NFL leagues and he wasn't credited.  This was additional payment by @Justin Rossano to @Paul Miller for Carlos Hyde!! I know you do  at this point, I hope you do.  WE aren't going to have any problems.  If I lose because of the 2 points we’re gonna have some problems  @Justin Rossano will you kindly tell @Andy Rangel to stop whining? I’m still waiting to hear from commissioner Justin They made a mistake. What’s their number?  I literally cannot control what espn enters stats in as.  if it was, espn would have given you the points.  Is that not considered a pass? got em lmao laterral.  Is this a rushing 2 point conversion to you?  https://cdn-vox--cdn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyEQqWxWfR9QJyz7KcxNyL4Rjfw=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9716045/your_move_andy.0.gif @Andy Rangel   I seriously need my two points!

 It’s much worse  Andy https://media2.giphy.com/media/CFJqC6fgQF4pG/giphy.gif I’m still salty about my 2 points tho I need them  😂😂😂 me doing my part to keep cody out of the playoffs. don't know how the fuck it worked but somehow it did... https://media1.giphy.com/media/e37RbTLYjfc1q/giphy.gif Paul with the upset 👀 Justin what are your thoughts?

Mccoy makes my dick hard Fucking bitch ass Asian shit fuck noodles choking bitches How the fuck is your whole team going to go into fucking OT @Nick Wayne I hope your team chokes on Asian noodles tonight for dinner TD!!! Kamara!!! PAUL GOING HAM!! That Jacksonville D. @Brian O'Cain  Nah, I had a feeling Paul might beat me. A lot of good matchups on his side. I’m just thankful my duct taped roster is holding their own this week Defense at 0 New orleans fell apart.   @Nick Brown thanks for doing your part to keep Cody out of the playoffs.  They've been alternating weeks  Murray needs to share the love They don't anymore tho My rbs used to do that  Dylan’s RBs doing work! 👁 @Justin Rossano you worried?  Fucking Cohen!

Added a graph for a visual aid of your odds of winning the survival pool.  And someone else  Justin  Who’s left in the survival pool? 
I keep losing track. Fuck yeah 🤤 That Waffle House tho! 🤤🤤🤤 Lol What my team is doing to poor Mason already   Honestly, 16 points is more than I thought he'd end with.  And Mariota had a decent game. Minus 4 interceptions  Crazy AB bailed me out.   Exactly my thinking  Antonio Brown should be thanking me for trading him. If I would have kept him, he would have not done anything and they probably would have lost.    Y'all need to stop doubting Mariota  @Chris Rangel We are going Monday! Should've started Rishard...holy shit...fuck my defense I just want to win this game...WOOOOOOO... It’s calling my name  https://media1.giphy.com/media/26FxCOdhlvEQXbeH6/giphy.gif This game is shitty I’m going to bed 👋🏽 😂 If you were in a fantasy football league, and wanting to acquire David Johnson....how would you go about it? Asking for a friend Woodyard acting like the Pain Train Lol damn he must be seeing shit after that  Bell just got leveled...  When have the titans been a high scoring team All the points have already been scored  Dam this could be a low scoring game 😩 THE VOODOO HAS SPOKEN!!! https://media1.giphy.com/media/W5YVAfSttCqre/giphy.gif Let’s go Davis 🗣🗣🗣 That's my QB That rushing td tho #future Davis 😎 Skycam is the best way to watch  That Pitt defense is strong tho #future Henry STROOOONNNGGGG I love using adoree on offense  But muh Mariota   Justin dropped him like https://media1.giphy.com/media/xUPGcEw56dJj3fJFJe/giphy.gif https://media1.giphy.com/media/3i7zenReaUuI0/giphy.gif #truth The decision was made the minute you picked him up. Full on Marcus boner 😭 https://media2.giphy.com/media/ktAQNsUfigR1K/giphy.gif I didn't make the start decision until 5 min before  I dropped Mariota to the waiver knowing Wes’ fanboy love would pick him up and start him. Secretly initiated the downfall 😱 I regret this decision  Interception Dayuuummmmm 🤤 God yes  😱😱 Mariota 60 yards to Davis pls Let’s go Corey DAVIS!!!  Huyyyyyy he said it’s a playoff thing ocain you wouldn’t understand @Brian O'Cain thx Wesley savage Dayuuum Can’t cover Antonio Sweet   Por que? For mis huevos  Por que no los dos?

I seem to recall several “Yeah, but how did you spend your winnings?” Comments @Chris Rangel  @Nick Wayne stop eye balling my bye week  Every time I go to sleep😔 https://media0.giphy.com/media/3ohs84fIGTJqYUr03u/giphy.gif Words hurt... What did I do to deserve this..yea I trash talk and say cody sucks and has a bald spot but that’s nothing to get me in a shitty division  I want that bye week Wesley is currently hoarding.  Look at my shorty division that I got cursed to be in You obviously are sitting fine  Just let me win Noooooooo. Demarco only.  😐downfall of dez Bryant Chris. I think I figured this whole downfall thing out. Could you initiate the downfall of Demarco? Pittsburghs uni's tonight are awesome  😂😂😂 #DUI #throwbackthursday 🤢🤢🤢 Pregame 😎 I don’t fucks with thin crust It’s my meal replacement Well it's a meal replacement shake so it replaced the pizza he's eating...right? 🤦‍♂️ Stop fucking lying. Your ass is eating pizza right now.   🤤🤤 Pregame  🤤 Already heading into week 12 like... http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/broke.gif Me, Wes, and Cody in the no money club like... https://m.popkey.co/e543bb/9GNOe.gif It's unlikely. I don’t see it happening with his remaining schedule  I will probably be physically sick if he makes it in.  Yes, it’s really all that matters at the moment  @Dylan Pine Just worry about not losing your playoff spot to @Cody Alexander  like why are all these players from different teams on the same plane with the entire Saints defense? we've been over this before, it's logistically challenging for all of them to be on the same plane.  i hope your whole team dies in a plane crash Shots fired It's a playoff thing. You wouldn't understand.  you paid 10 bucks for mariota!? 😂 So did @Andy Rangel  I just joined club no money   😂😂😂 @Cody Alexander is flat broke Damn @Nick Wayne what are you going to do with all that money?   😎 I see you 'mirin my lineup  Hope you enjoy Kirk Cousins Paul I tried to add him back for zilch but it was a no go 😩 True 👀 Never know. Fantasy football is a fickle bitch sometimes  Slaughter fest... 🤦🏽‍♂️🧠🤷🏽‍♂️ Mason, then Cody, then Paul Not sure Who does Wes play this week?  That line up scares the shit out of me!  I saw that earlier. Not a surprise. He has been working on that one Damn Wes...making super sneaky moves 🐭 😂 https://media3.giphy.com/media/l0HlBO7eyXzSZkJri/giphy.gif Copy let’s do this 😎🤞🏽 Ok. I will send it right over. Make sure you are waiting and ready to accept it  Nope that’s all 😊 Ummmmmmmmm Anything else? Let me get Ertz too 👀 Let me get freeman for CJ Anderson!  Then I will have to get them trades in before the deadline It’s good man. They will be healthy soon enough  Yeah that sucks 😬 All of my players felt like getting injured at the same time  😭😭😭 Mmmmmmm. I plan on it Enjoy Jamaal Williams Justin 😩🤬😭  https://media0.giphy.com/media/YTbZzCkRQCEJa/giphy.gif https://media3.giphy.com/media/mXyenbUUgDP3O/giphy.gif @Nick Wayne can I get that week 1 bye week, pls?

Survivor pool @Brian O'Cain is out.
Transaction fees are up to $127.50. 
@Nick Brown and @Wes Young had a tight game as did @Dylan Pine and @Nick Wayne . @Nathaniel Collier took a loss while his bench quietly scored more than @Brian O'Cain's team. 
Also, David Johnson's cast came off and he is still available. 😉 Words hurt Wesley.  Honestly went to be expecting to lose.  It was just a little bit.  @Wes Young That felt malicious. 😢 @Dylan Pine you better not let Cody in  https://media0.giphy.com/media/13Cmju3maIjStW/giphy.gif Willis and Stallone divisions are very interesting  @Nick @Nick  Fun fact. I have never lost a game to a Nick  https://media1.giphy.com/media/BOLgyQq6NFfhu/giphy.gif No one else likes Asian chicks??????? 🙂 https://media0.giphy.com/media/4xLPYsyuqOWWY/giphy.gif When you peeking in the playoff door like  http://jarviscity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jack-nicholson-the-shining.gif Playoffs Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! https://media3.giphy.com/media/S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o/giphy.gif Now stay tuned for internet Asian porn  https://m.popkey.co/5ba688/MwZYz.gif  well fuck The haircut gives it away...just screams “I love Asian women”  I feel like Derek Anderson has a thing for Asian women too 👁 😂 Let's get those backups in!!!!

Stewart with a 9 point cushion is scary 😱 Asian Nick, your game is most interesting tomorrow night  Cody be like.  https://media0.giphy.com/media/pNpONEEg3pLIQ/giphy.gif 😂😂😂 If an Amendola or Sanders garbage touchdown happens, Cody loses  How can he sleep so soundly with David Johnson still on his roster? Cody dreaming his team will make the playoffs this year  If someone drops at this point, it’s because they don’t want to enjoy life anymore  I’ve never lost to Wes 😬 I just hope we can continue this tradition for years to come  😬 Fucking Wes!!!! 😱 Shots fired  😂 Fun fact, I've never lost a game to @Nick Wayne  Fun fact.

We both have only 2 players left on our team that we got from the draft.  Get your Johnson here! Johnson available Got a red hot Baldwin for sale Baldwin here. Hopkins anyone Got a Hopkins for sale Hopkins here no one cares about them. What about david johnson?  Ajayi and Kelce for sale...mmmmmmm... Chris, you’re not yourself when you’re hungry  What the fuck ads?!?!? Going back to cbs  Andy still real hurt about losing to Mason.  It should be the same as is until next season. Nothing else should be changed  👎🏽 The league message board is on ESPN. 3. Requests may be submitted up until 5 minutes before game time. It is the responsibility of the commissioner and co-commissioner to ensure the players are on the correct team before game time. We will do our best to process these requests early. It is the team manager’s responsibility to add that player to their starting lineup once the add/drop has been processed. After talking with Wes this morning, we are making it possible to add/drop anyone on Sunday, not just for emergencies. Free agency will be open, without having to spend your FAAB budget. This is the way the ESPN setting was originally intended to be. The way that it works is:

1. Following the FAAB processing at 10pm CST on Saturday night, players remaining will be available on a first come/first serve basis. 

2. You request the player(s) by accessing the league message board (NOT GROUPME). Everyone is able to access it via the app and desktop version. The reason for this is because: any messages in the board show up in the activity feed with the FAAB transactions and it is time stamped. We have the ability to reply to the requests individually. This allows Wes and myself the ability to process the requests as they are received.

For transparency, please submit any player request you have in the group chat. Players will be added based on the order they are sent in the chat. I wouldn’t take that Ohhhhh he said fuck @Andy Rangel  Players can be added on Sunday morning.  The*  Ajayi just showed up oh shit with as many targets that Sterling Shepard has had already, he'd have 33 points if he had a decent QB 👀 AJ Green just got ejected.  That's the league today  Did anyone just see the Cincinnati Jacksonville fight?  I have an emergency.  Way to change your QB last minute mmmmm abuse that power Good pick up sir Bye Safe to say Wes won Jared Goff going the fuck off  Never mind penalty on cin Mmmmm let the bench points commence I know R. Woods @Chris Rangel  Collusion shady  The voice of reason already spoke.  😂😂😂  @Wes Young I'm playing Justin this week so this is on you man! By the way there any other “shady” rules I should know about going forward?  Meanwhile there is a floor not being grouted and a wall not getting painted @Cody Alexander  And when you find out your player might not play a week before he plays save your waiver wire money and swap him out an hour before the game. Who cares about Managing your team right? Who cares about waiver deadlines right?  https://v.groupme.com/32336378/2017-11-05T18:23:09Z/68b0d26e.320x568r.mp4 would have been nice to know  @Nick Wayne  VOICE OF REASON, WHERE ARE YOU I'm not sure what you expected League of low expectations  Yup even if them being questionable is not new? 😂😂 too brown... As long as their questionable Dylan it’s considered an emergency  Just like that Yes Swap him for wrong skin color..boom done Correct so if i just decide to swap someone sunday morning, i can do it for free before kickoff for any reason? I’m just here to nag😁 No one had an issue when it was done for paul. Soooooooooo Shaaaaaaaaaaady  Nah it seemed right for the commissioner to do it you could have switched him yourself earlier https://media1.giphy.com/media/l378uVhvl0T2FvDdC/giphy.gif game was started I asked to switch Walker Okay everyone. Here's where we stand. This was able to be done by the team manager in cbs. We (me) missed a setting that couldn't be changed after entering everyone's players. I have not talked to Justin yet. He didn't have me add the player for him, which is how it should have been done. That being said, had he asked me to drop/add the player, I would have. We've done it for Paul twice this season, and I would do it for anyone else that asked as well. https://media3.giphy.com/media/dYhSVzw5X7shq/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff5527496c704d4d3ac703 Picked up Howard for NOTHING then picks up Burton for NOTHING too. How convenient.  Is that Wes Not only did Justin easily swap out his TE but he also didn’t LOSE any waiver wire money 😂👍🏽 https://media3.giphy.com/media/l2Je2XRAS5jl8On0k/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff53f96a67337a77e08ab8 😂😂😂  It’s quiet now Lol this is fun  Commission my shit dammit https://media0.giphy.com/media/NipFetnQOuKhW/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff5371514872464dd92df2 I requested dammit Why even have waiver wire money 🤷🏽‍♂️ since players are questionable and it’s considered an “emergency” I can just easily add a player I want 👍🏽 What the fuck I don’t see Delanie in my line up it got real quiet in here I’ll just keep my players and when I find out they’re not playing that day I’ll just request a free sudden add in 👍🏽 I need to replace Delanie let’s go Might as well not even have waiver wire...should be free for all  Exactly  So if I have a player that is questionable all week and they decide not to play him. That is considered an emergency? If you let a game start, that's on you  The games had already started  Bit different Andy.  He didn’t even play and nobody gave him the option to change him out... What about OCAINs player on Thursday...  https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7aTyCYXgNm55wDjq/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff50e54c304170559c4ed4 SUPER SHADY!!!   That’s just poor management call man  And you did it twice this morning @Justin Rossano 🤔 Andy it was in week 1’s edition of the magazine I don’t recall questionable being an emergency... The rule only exists for the morning of emergencies  So when we switched to ESPN and I missed the setting, Paul called me at goddamn 7 am @Nick Brown  https://media3.giphy.com/media/iGTHPFZZS4WnC/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff4fea78324b313681d7e9 First come first serve @Andy Rangel  Gotcha With CBS you could pick up a free agent in Sunday  So if my TE suddenly got hurt before today...and I wanted the same TE as Justin then what?  I’m thinking that rule should only apply during playoffs. Not Reg season. But that’s just me.  I'd have preferred it be requested instead of done  You're not wrong @Nick Wayne.  Good luck 2 everyone except @Dylan Pine  That's all I'm gonna say about this.   You can't have shady, nick hes already on a team.  The deadlines make it competitive without any gray area  Shady.  Anyone else?  Cool Naw I’m good. I prefer to win fair and square or lose fair and square  � Deangelo Williams (I’m pretty sure that’s who he wanted) It's for of DeShaun Watson breaks his leg at 10 am on Sunday and you have to have a qb  What d Williams?  No to pick up players that you'd add through the week.  Its for game time decisions   I can understand the thing with Paul but this is super shady... So it’s done for Justin because his #1 TE is ruled out for today???  😂  It's been done twice all year.. Both times for Paul because he was too lazy to manage throughout the week Nick Wayne did you know about this sudden add/drop on Sunday?? I’m good @Wes Young  🙄 wow shady shit going on  Requests will be made in the order they're received  Wes did you do it already??? Gonna go give Marcus a pregame pep talk Wes make this happen! Add Williams and drop CJ  I need him  What have you done Justin...  I have an open spot I want Williams  The intent of it is for replacing game time decisions not picking through the wire while it's free... Justin/Wes add D Williams and drop CJ Anderson  @Nick Wayne yes  😂😂😂 Blame chris So we just tell you guys who we want from the waiver and you add the for us immediately? I agree Should have stayed with CBS  Next year...  You're supposed to be able to pick up free agents on Sunday  I fucked up the league settings for waivers by picking the wrong option and we couldn't change it without redrafting Shit manual/edit my shit!!   Order in the court!   Week one fool... Since when we’re we able to do that???!!! Manual add drops. Wes and I are able to do it. We’ve had to do it for Paul a couple times this year because of the ESPN league settings You taking advantage of your “commissioner” powers to “edit”  Convenient.  🤔  How did you suddenly add/drop players today Justin??? Mine won’t go through till the 7th???  https://media2.giphy.com/media/26BRzQS5HXcEWM7du/giphy.gif?fingerprint=a058f94b59ff3fc44d646b7541b2c8af Already replaced.

Should have been ejected.  I can't believe he wasn't ejected as intentional as it was... Yeah my dude is out out 😰 I don't know...it was vicious and not like big hit like dirty as fuck low blow... It was bad. I don’t think it broke, but he may be broken Helmet to helmet hit ???? Season ending out? Oh shit! Like on a stretcher out Did his mask break? Out out??? I didn't catch the replay That was nasty.  😱 Adams is out...dirty hit..
 Mmm electric and pellet smokers are legit  I have one time on a charcoal grill. Tomorrow will be on a pellet grill. I can't wait   😱 have you done it before I am smoking it  He's not about it @Brian O'Cain  @Brian O'Cain  ? Are you Are you smoking it Smoking it @Brian O'Cain  Mmmm Brisket tomorrow.....  🤦🏼‍♂️ Glennon just kicked the snap 10 yards to Green Bay The bears are so baf 😂 Lol Why are you in a hospital with Paul? 👀 OCAIN let me get Adams!!! Co-commissioner material written all over that kid congrats buddy Congrats bud!!!! Congratulations!!!!! That is a awesome....  Looking like a WR... @Mason Brewer  needs to pick him up off of waivers... Wingspan Be looking like he need titties..give em thr titties That’s my motherfucking nephew wooooooooo   It's escalated Terrorist  Them* Well, you keep picking me up buddy. You will strike gold soon enough  If I could sign a player that knows how to stretch before the game it would be alright with me Transaction king bitches!!! Mason better not try and steal my title Chris Rangel is going to 'TopGolf And Football' Still early in the season  I'm cool with that  O'cains defense scored 32 points in week one.  My kicker has been on point lately.  Use money for highest points scored by kicker or defense  Had to wear the right shirt so the first thing my baby sees is a Titans logo I think it gets put into the league pool, and used for league things...paying for last place things, league meetings, trophy upgrades etc It's 🔥 I want your job Wes. Day drinking and playing fantasy football.  I could use a case of beer right about now The money needs to be used on something that benefits everyone in the league. I'm not sure exactly what that is though.  We need to vote on what we're going to do... Any ideas? Anyone else? In my opinion - if we used it for TopGolf or any event it should for flat fee thing... Like TopGolf for instance the bay rentals not for food and drinks ever unless it's for like a tailgate where we are getting a finite amount of food and beer or a party at someones house where you can say we're going to get 10 pizzas and 2 cases of beer... It should take care of most of food and drinks  Use it on top golf  can we get a stripper at topgolf? We are getting the CBS refund back - got the confirmation email this morning. Does anyone have any ideas about what they would like to do with it?... Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul!!!!! you have been missed welcome home hey paul! Thanks @Dylan Pine for the workaround...  @Paul Miller stop pouting @Paul Miller is back in GroupMe..

Duuuuuuuummmmmmbbbbbbbbb... 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ Paul said he gets out of church at 1:15 on Sundays so he's out... When you backing out of TopGolf @Nick Wayne ?...

Just found my lucky autographed Marshall Faulk NFL Draft '94 Classic card!! Cody Alexander is going to 'TopGolf And Football' Cody Alexander is undecided about 'TopGolf And Football' It’s my all correct. But in cbs, Chris beat Andy 😂 cody cancel the refund We're going back I won in cbs Just read that       Since CBS is still up....for your viewing pleasure  I'm shocked by that score... I’m with Mason. He is shocked about the news of the survivor pool  Week 3 -
Most points in season - Justin 381.4
Most points single week - Justin 151.5
Survivor pool - Mason is out
We are up to $35.00 in transaction fees. 
We have submitted the request for the CBS refund and are awaiting a response from them.  duhhhhhhh.... Week 3 complete -  https://media3.giphy.com/media/xT9DPhONuz1SpCONiM/giphy.gif 151.5 Had to explain to Chris that there isn't one for most transactions... Just so there’s no confusion, there is no ancillary category for a one week LOW score Mason with a historically bad week still in that survivor pool! woooo Mason with 38.6 😱 Safe to say I left some points on the bench  Just how does it feel to damn near score 4 times higher than the lowest scorer this week?!

I'm not sure but I think so... @Justin Rossano  what time is titans game? isn't it right next to nissan? we don't want to be coming or going at the same time they are... I would say noon so we could watch some games together... In the bays? Drinking and golf have been hobbies of mine for years  Do they have TV’s for nfl on Sunday? Sounds cool to me What time would we want to do it? Price scales up the later we go... I'm down. That sounds like fun   We will also get 10% off the bay rental for firefighter discount... It's like a driving range but with scoring and I believe they have a few game modes to choose from... those are at crazy horse @Andy Rangel  That's not bad as long as we have several that want to go! So it’s like a driving range? Unlimited balls to hit and clubs...you have to buy a $5 membership card the first time you go... Bitches with low self esteem? Drinks? What is included Cody? damn that's cheap as fuck.  That's the bay rental price...total... so $25 total for 6 for the hour!? or $25 each? You can have 6 people per bay, bays rent by the hour... Thompson!!! 😍😍😍  Shots fired still woulda beat the shit out of @Wes Young  He normally gets good projections then nobody shows up on Sunday  Have you seen his team? surely by that time he will have beaten someone... Paul is done with us.  My bday is next year 🤔 Huh? 🤔 Why don't you ask for a unicorn for your birthday Andy.  Cody doesn't have any friends so he doesn't understand 👍🏽 Paul actually brings the house down with karaoke  Oh yeah! AND I WANT PAUL TO BE THERE!!! 🤤🤤🤤 League outing downtown Nashville  No you actually enjoy it don't try to not sound lame here... TopGolf... Andy enjoys taking out of town friends  In that area.  That lunch shift.... It's mainly his people.  top golf then crazy horse? Not going anywhere east of 12th to hang out...I'm not a tourist or an idiot...Andy loves it down there... https://media3.giphy.com/media/S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o/giphy.gif And beer 🤤🤤🤤 Wings and burgers 🤤🤤🤤 I thought it was just golf You know they got food at top golf Justin   Golf Top Gold then Hooters downtown?

At the 0-3 Bar and Grill with Cody  Where is Paul?!!! The only reason Cody even made the playoffs last year is because he "happend" to play John the last game of the regular season.

Of course he does Gave up cooks and he gets angry Dammit Wes In solidarity with Kaepernick, the colts and browns have decided to kneel for the entire game.  That is true.  Zero is better than the negative 40 they would have had.  Well good thing defenses don't go negative cause Baltimore's shit the bed today.   Since I started buck over Howard. He will put up 30 TE with 24 fucking points Good lawd  Go ahead and gimme Lewis too Lewis is going off Putting in my waiver claim for Bortles now If Wes gets kicked out this week is it like Paul got kicked out twice?...

This is the league of low expectations 🤷🏽‍♂️  if anybody was gonna delete it it should have been cody. he's also 0-2 and it was definitely malicious https://media1.giphy.com/media/EsmlrgWNx5v0Y/giphy.gif He said some of our comments felt malicious  I told him he was being a bitch  well damn. maybe if he wins one week he will add it back No lie Paul deleted the GroupMe app. He said he didn’t need this drama where is paul? is he still in the league?

They started Thomas Rawls instead of Tevin Coleman, despite the experts' prediction that Coleman should have played. I'm going to miss these reports Coach Collier certainly can't blame the loss on Rob Gronkowski, who scored 17.6 points. Gronkowski was back to doing Gronk things- like scoring an impressive deep TD and leaving the game with an injury. Nice!!!!  Real truck right there  Only catch is that I have to trade my truck in on it  Only live once. Getting that for my room at the station  Damn, Cap. That's a hefty price tag.  #captainsmoney Can someone meet me in Franklin and help me load this up?  👍 everyone has joined the espn league so I guess so.

Chill Exactly like when you lose electricity  You mean the guy who paid for something we're not using? We can get outages and ads for free... 🤤🤤 Plus espn is built user friendly Don't be that guy "other nick" jk, espn is free #buildthewall We're switching to ESPN and CBS is going to pay for it! I want my $15 back! With cbs crashing yesterday the way it did that wasn't good and the fucking ads are annoying scores are being archived from CBS so if there is any trouble, we'll have it to refer back to.  It's for the better It will all be good gents the scores will be updated manually for week 1 & 2 and will use ESPN going forward.  Paul where you at I want to see how you feel 😳 This could get dicey.  😩😩😩 only way to switch was to import lineups as they are currently Too much change I have to adjust them manually The ESPN app does scoring differently. It's fucking with point totals from last week.  claims shouldn't process until Wednesday anyways so we should be good on that.  Wes, you are the best. I truly appreciate you not working today and knocking this out Switching to ESPN. If you have any waiver wire claims currently submitted, please cancel them. All other claims, please wait until tomorrow to submit 😂😂 Ha, good interpretation  maybe it's every team vs the bears Nor do i.

Disclaimer: ESPN scoring is still being adjusted.  Let's do it. This is going to help my record......  Let me just make a quick lineup change  Damn, I'm losing in ESPN too.  You the real MVP Scoring is really close but needs some fine tuning on defense  You still my hero Before anyone gets uppity I'm testing it out and there are still settings to adjust. Week 1 doesn't match at all due to how many roster changes were made.  That's my hero  Dayummmmmmm Ughhhhh he did it  😍 space dog  Yup broke his nail I still have one player to play. Is Abdullah out?  @Brian O'Cain lost... Merica  What is going on?  😂😂😂 Out of a magazine I'm taking Brady 1st round Can we redraft too Customer satisfaction is not good.

Not to be out of the pool this week!!  What did you expect 😂 I don't know why I expected more out of this league.  Ok, I thought so. It updated like he did, then they took it away and then added it back again  Adams  Who caught that td?  It just updated then  No sir, you are very close  ??? Yes, I am not that close. They gave Adam's the points for td and then took them back  I do believe it was a large margin Wasn't Nate favored by like 20 points this week? There is a sliver of light on the horizon  O'Cain about to put Nate outta the pool Thank you now go for 2 It's bed time  https://media0.giphy.com/media/LiRoVoHjMa5bO/giphy.gif Crickets out there  Atta boi!

Let's not be petty. I could have benched both of my Chiefs players, not started anyone in their places, and you still would have lost.  If you guys use the desktop to look at the week 1 analysis, you can add comments to your section  Mine said "Getting beat by a real person that actually drafted more than one player from the Chiefs (on purpose) is like getting raped by a baby. It's highly unlikely but if it happens once then by the laws of probability you can be certain it will never happen again." I can't help what the app says buddy Is this like Weekend at Bernies? He is upright but still dead  Just complete step one of Justin's instructions.   @Wes Young Possibly.... Can we bury his head and just give him a breathing tube? is he dead? 😂😂😂  Oh sweet baby Jesus  That's a stranger FYI... He drank a single Zima...@Justin Rossano  man I love these.  Show me the TD's decided the whole 'scoring points' thing was passe 😂😂😂 a Michelob ultra  What in the hell did he drink to end up that way? That will do #L  Can you please write "Week 1 Loser" in the sand on him please? #lightweight  I was wondering if they did it from each perspective.  They emailed me all of them. There were only 6 let's see them posts @Cody Alexander @Andy Rangel @Paul Miller @Brian O'Cain @Mason Brewer @Nick Brown  can we see some of the losers articles?  keep them coming these are so cool  https://www.musiccitymiracles.com/2017/9/12/16296300/paul-kuharsky-gets-asked-to-take-day-off-from-midday-180-after-run-in-blaine-bishop-wake-up-zone Meanwhile, Andy Dalton stuck out as the worst performer for Chicken in a Biscuit, scoring -3 points. Dalton was so bad that fans chanted for him to be traded and even threw things at him as he left the field. Chicken in a Biscuit also had to deal with a poor effort from Rob Kelley (6.3 points below expected).

One year only pick white players. #MakeFootballGreatAgain Lemme get Ray Lewis for my RB Aaron Hernandez 1st round I'm drafting all felons this year.

He is a fucking disgrace to Tennessee Except he don't drink beer and he don't like catfish @Wes Young  It'll take Paul a week to understand how to download GroupMe...  Damn son....hard core.  I'm a classy bitch lol I'm a bitch...that's hurtful You made it personal when you said bitches Damn chris.....this was about phones....now you wanting to pull in my genetics?

Says the person going to the minor league next year... Fuck an iphone....and the bitches who use them.  I don't think so... Pretty cool. Cody can you pin messages at the top or anything? Created new poll 'Who thinks that Androids are fuckin gay?': https://s.groupme.com/30VStTq Ohhhhhh okay They haven't set the app up yet.

Paul Miller is new to GroupMe and hasn't responded, so we stopped sending them messages from this group. Jeremy Conner is new to GroupMe and hasn't responded, so we stopped sending them messages from this group. Aye Aye All in favor?  Dylan, you're a GD genius  I vote fuck yes... can we make a stip that if you have an android and you win you have to spend your prize money on upgrading to an iPhone? Commissioner approved I like this idea We're going to pick up enough IPhone people and make the Androids go to a minor league next year 👍🏼... https://media3.giphy.com/media/depb1Ex1DUbsY/giphy.gif This should work better for everyone... see if the androids can hang now Cody Alexander added Andy Rangel, Brian O'Cain, Dylan Pine, Justin Rossano, Nathaniel Collier, and 6 others to the group.
